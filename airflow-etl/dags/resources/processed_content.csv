If the Durbin–Watson statistic from a trend model differs significantly from 2, indicating serial correlation, we need to build a different kind of model., An autoregressive model of order p, denoted AR(p), uses p lags of a time series to predict its current value: xt = b 0 + b 1 xt −1 + b 2 xt −2 + . . . + bpxt – p + ε t ., A time series is covariance stationary if the following three conditions are satisfied: First, the expected value of the time series must be constant and finite in all periods. Second, the variance of the time series must be constant and finite in all periods. Third, the covariance of the time series with itself for a fixed number of periods in the past or future must be constant and finite in all periods. Inspection of a nonstationary time-series plot may reveal an upward or downward trend (nonconstant mean) and/or nonconstant variance. The use of linear regression to estimate an autoregressive time-series model is not valid unless the time series is covariance stationary., For a specific autoregressive model to be a good fit to the data, the autocorrelations of the error term should be 0 at all lags., A time series is mean reverting if it tends to fall when its level is above its long-run mean and rise when its level is below its long-run mean. If a time series is covariance stationary, then it will be mean reverting., The one-period-ahead forecast of a variable xt from an AR(1) model made in period t for period t + 1 is x ‸ t + 1 = b ‸ 0 + b ‸ 1 x t . This forecast can be used to create the two-period-ahead forecast from the model made in period t, x ‸ t + 2 = b ‸ 0 + b ‸ 1 x t + 1 . Similar results hold for AR(p) models., In-sample forecasts are the in-sample predicted values from the estimated time-series model. Out-of-sample forecasts are the forecasts made from the estimated time-series model for a time period different from the one for which the model was estimated. Out-of-sample forecasts are usually more valuable in evaluating the forecasting performance of a time-series model than are in-sample forecasts. The root mean squared error (RMSE), defined as the square root of the average squared forecast error, is a criterion for comparing the forecast accuracy of different time-series models; a smaller RMSE implies greater forecast accuracy., Just as in regression models, the coefficients in time-series models are often unstable across different sample periods. In selecting a sample period for estimating a time-series model, we should seek to assure ourselves that the time series was stationary in the sample period., A random walk is a time series in which the value of the series in one period is the value of the series in the previous period plus an unpredictable random error. If the time series is a random walk, it is not covariance stationary. A random walk with drift is a random walk with a nonzero intercept term. All random walks have unit roots. If a time series has a unit root, then it will not be covariance stationary., If a time series has a unit root, we can sometimes transform the time series into one that is covariance stationary by first-differencing the time series; we may then be able to estimate an autoregressive model for the first-differenced series., An n-period moving average of the current and past (n − 1) values of a time series, xt , is calculated as [xt + xt −1 + . . . + xt −( n −1)]/n., A moving-average model of order q, denoted MA(q), uses q lags of a random error term to predict its current value., The order q of a moving-average model can be determined using the fact that if a time series is a moving-average time series of order q, its first q autocorrelations are nonzero while autocorrelations beyond the first q are zero., The autocorrelations of most autoregressive time series start large and decline gradually, whereas the autocorrelations of an MA(q) time series suddenly drop to 0 after the first q autocorrelations. This helps in distinguishing between autoregressive and moving-average time series., If the error term of a time-series model shows significant serial correlation at seasonal lags, the time series has significant seasonality. This seasonality can often be modeled by including a seasonal lag in the model, such as adding a term lagged four quarters to an AR(1) model on quarterly observations., The forecast made in time t for time t + 1 using a quarterly AR(1) model with a seasonal lag would be x t + 1 = b ‸ 0 + b ‸ 1 x t + b ‸ 2 x t − 3 ., ARMA models have several limitations: The parameters in ARMA models can be very unstable; determining the AR and MA order of the model can be difficult; and even with their additional complexity, ARMA models may not forecast well., The variance of the error in a time-series model sometimes depends on the variance of previous errors, representing autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH). Analysts can test for first-order ARCH in a time-series model by regressing the squared residual on the squared residual from the previous period. If the coefficient on the squared residual is statistically significant, the time-series model has ARCH(1) errors., If a time-series model has ARCH(1) errors, then the variance of the errors in period t + 1 can be predicted in period t using the formula σ ‸ t + 1 2 = a ‸ 0 + a ‸ 1 ε ‸ t 2 ., If linear regression is used to model the relationship between two time series, a test should be performed to determine whether either time series has a unit root: If neither of the time series has a unit root, then we can safely use linear regression. If one of the two time series has a unit root, then we should not use linear regression. If both time series have a unit root and the time series are cointegrated, we may safely use linear regression; however, if they are not cointegrated, we should not use linear regression. The (Engle–Granger) Dickey–Fuller test can be used to determine whether time series are cointegrated., If neither of the time series has a unit root, then we can safely use linear regression., If one of the two time series has a unit root, then we should not use linear regression., If both time series have a unit root and the time series are cointegrated, we may safely use linear regression; however, if they are not cointegrated, we should not use linear regression.

Credit Analysis Models,2024 Curriculum,CFA Program Level II,Fixed Income,"The member should be able to: explain expected exposure, the loss given default, the probability of default, and the credit valuation adjustment; explain credit scores and credit ratings; calculate the expected return on a bond given transition in its credit rating; explain structural and reduced-form models of corporate credit risk, including assumptions, strengths, and weaknesses; calculate the value of a bond and its credit spread, given assumptions about the credit risk parameters; interpret changes in a credit spread; explain the determinants of the term structure of credit spreads and interpret a term structure of credit spreads; compare the credit analysis required for securitized debt to the credit analysis of corporate debt.","The member should be able to: explain expected exposure, the loss given default, the probability of default, and the credit valuation adjustment; explain credit scores and credit ratings; calculate the expected return on a bond given transition in its credit rating; explain structural and reduced-form models of corporate credit risk, including assumptions, strengths, and weaknesses; calculate the value of a bond and its credit spread, given assumptions about the credit risk parameters; interpret changes in a credit spread; explain the determinants of the term structure of credit spreads and interpret a term structure of credit spreads; compare the credit analysis required for securitized debt to the credit analysis of corporate debt.","Three factors important to modeling credit risk are the expected exposure to default, the recovery rate, and the loss given default., These factors permit the calculation of a credit valuation adjustment that is subtracted from the (hypothetical) value of the bond, if it were default risk free, to get the bond’s fair value given its credit risk. The credit valuation adjustment is calculated as the sum of the present values of the expected loss for each period in the remaining life of the bond. Expected values are computed using risk-neutral probabilities, and discounting is done at the risk-free rates for the relevant maturities., The CVA captures investors’ compensation for bearing default risk. The compensation can also be expressed in terms of a credit spread., Credit scores and credit ratings are third-party evaluations of creditworthiness used in distinct markets., Analysts may use credit ratings and a transition matrix of probabilities to adjust a bond’s yield-to-maturity to reflect the probabilities of credit migration. Credit spread migration typically reduces expected return., Credit analysis models fall into two broad categories: structural models and reduced-form models., Structural models are based on an option perspective of the positions of the stakeholders of the company. Bondholders are viewed as owning the assets of the company; shareholders have call options on those assets., Reduced-form models seek to predict when a default may occur, but they do not explain the why as do structural models. Reduced-form models, unlike structural models, are based only on observable variables., When interest rates are assumed to be volatile, the credit risk of a bond can be estimated in an arbitrage-free valuation framework., The discount margin for floating-rate notes is similar to the credit spread for fixed-coupon bonds. The discount margin can also be calculated using an arbitrage-free valuation framework., Arbitrage-free valuation can be applied to judge the sensitivity of the credit spread to changes in credit risk parameters., The term structure of credit spreads depends on macro and micro factors., As it concerns macro factors, the credit spread curve tends to become steeper and widen in conditions of weak economic activity. Market supply and demand dynamics are important. The most frequently traded securities tend to determine the shape of this curve., Issuer- or industry-specific factors, such as the chance of a future leverage-decreasing event, can cause the credit spread curve to flatten or invert., When a bond is very likely to default, it often trades close to its recovery value at various maturities; moreover, the credit spread curve is less informative about the relationship between credit risk and maturity., For securitized debt, the characteristics of the asset portfolio themselves suggest the best approach for a credit analyst to take when deciding among investments. Important considerations include the relative concentration of assets and their similarity or heterogeneity as it concerns credit risk.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level2/level2a/RR_2024_L2V4R8_credit_analysis_models.pdf,

Alternative investments include investments in five main categories: hedge funds, private capital, natural resources, real estate, and infrastructure., Alternative investment strategies are typically active, return-seeking strategies that also often have risk characteristics different from those of traditional long-only investments., Characteristics common to many alternative investments, when compared with traditional investments, include the following: lower liquidity, less regulation, lower transparency, higher fees, and limited and potentially problematic historical risk and return data., Alternative investments often have complex legal and tax considerations and may be highly leveraged., Alternative investments are attractive to investors because of the potential for portfolio diversification resulting in a higher risk-adjusted return for the portfolio., Investors can access alternative invests in three ways:",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2022/pdf/introduction-alternative-investments.pdf,
Credit Default Swaps,2024 Curriculum,CFA Program Level II,Fixed Income,"The member should be able to: describe credit default swaps (CDS), single-name and index CDS, and the parameters that define a given CDS product; describe credit events and settlement protocols with respect to CDS; explain the principles underlying and factors that influence the market’s pricing of CDS; describe the use of CDS to manage credit exposures and to express views regarding changes in the shape and/or level of the credit curve; describe the use of CDS to take advantage of valuation disparities among separate markets, such as bonds, loans, equities, and equity-linked instruments.","The member should be able to: describe credit default swaps (CDS), single-name and index CDS, and the parameters that define a given CDS product; describe credit events and settlement protocols with respect to CDS; explain the principles underlying and factors that influence the market’s pricing of CDS; describe the use of CDS to manage credit exposures and to express views regarding changes in the shape and/or level of the credit curve; describe the use of CDS to take advantage of valuation disparities among separate markets, such as bonds, loans, equities, and equity-linked instruments.","A credit default swap (CDS) is a contract between two parties in which one party purchases protection from another party against losses from the default of a borrower for a defined period of time., A CDS is written on the debt of a third party, called the reference entity, whose relevant debt is called the reference obligation, typically a senior unsecured bond., A CDS written on a particular reference obligation normally provides coverage for all obligations of the reference entity that have equal or higher seniority., The two parties to the CDS are the credit protection buyer, who is said to be short the reference entity’s credit, and the credit protection seller, who is said to be long the reference entity’s credit., The CDS pays off upon occurrence of a credit event, which includes bankruptcy, failure to pay, and, in some countries, involuntary restructuring., Settlement of a CDS can occur through a cash payment from the credit protection seller to the credit protection buyer as determined by the cheapest-to-deliver obligation of the reference entity or by physical delivery of the reference obligation from the protection buyer to the protection seller in exchange for the CDS notional., A cash settlement payoff is determined by an auction of the reference entity’s debt, which gives the market’s assessment of the likely recovery rate. The credit protection buyer must accept the outcome of the auction even though the ultimate recovery rate could differ., CDS can be constructed on a single entity or as indexes containing multiple entities. Bespoke CDS or baskets of CDS are also common., The fixed payments made from CDS buyer to CDS seller are customarily set at a fixed annual rate of 1% for investment-grade debt or 5% for high-yield debt., Valuation of a CDS is determined by estimating the present value of the payment leg, which is the series of payments made from the protection buyer to the protection seller, and the present value of the protection leg, which is the payment from the protection seller to the protection buyer in event of default. If the present value of the payment leg is greater than the present value of the protection leg, the protection buyer pays an upfront premium to the seller. If the present value of the protection leg is greater than the present value of the payment leg, the seller pays an upfront premium to the buyer., An important determinant of the value of the expected payments is the hazard rate, the probability of default given that default has not already occurred., CDS prices are often quoted in terms of credit spreads, the implied number of basis points that the credit protection seller receives from the credit protection buyer to justify providing the protection., Credit spreads are often expressed in terms of a credit curve, which expresses the relationship between the credit spreads on bonds of different maturities for the same borrower., CDS change in value over their lives as the credit quality of the reference entity changes, which leads to gains and losses for the counterparties, even though default may not have occurred or may never occur. CDS spreads approach zero as the CDS approaches maturity., Either party can monetize an accumulated gain or loss by entering into an offsetting position that matches the terms of the original CDS., CDS are used to increase or decrease credit exposures or to capitalize on different assessments of the cost of credit among different instruments tied to the reference entity, such as debt, equity, and derivatives of debt and equity.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level2/level2a/RR_2024_L2V4R9_credit_default_swaps.pdf,

Market frictions are nil. Short selling is allowed with full use of proceeds. The underlying instrument price follows a known distribution. Borrowing and lending is available at a known risk-free rate., Replicating instruments are identifiable and investable., Market frictions are nil., Short selling is allowed with full use of proceeds., The underlying instrument price follows a known distribution., Borrowing and lending is available at a known risk-free rate., The two-period binomial model can be viewed as three one-period binomial models, one positioned at Time 0 and two positioned at Time 1., In general, European-style options can be valued based on the expectations approach in which the option value is determined as the present value of the expected future option payouts, where the discount rate is the risk-free rate and the expectation is taken based on the risk-neutral probability measure., Both American-style options and European-style options can be valued based on the no-arbitrage approach, which provides clear interpretations of the component terms; the option value is determined by working backward through the binomial tree to arrive at the correct current value., For American-style options, early exercise influences the option values and hedge ratios as one works backward through the binomial tree., Interest rate option valuation requires the specification of an entire term structure of interest rates, so valuation is often estimated via a binomial tree., A key assumption of the Black–Scholes–Merton option valuation model is that the return of the underlying instrument follows geometric Brownian motion, implying a lognormal distribution of the return., The BSM model can be interpreted as a dynamically managed portfolio of the underlying instrument and zero-coupon bonds., BSM model interpretations related to N(d1) are that it is the basis for the number of units of underlying instrument to replicate an option, that it is the primary determinant of delta, and that it answers the question of how much the option value will change for a small change in the underlying., BSM model interpretations related to N(d2) are that it is the basis for the number of zero-coupon bonds to acquire to replicate an option and that it is the basis for estimating the risk-neutral probability of an option expiring in the money., The Black futures option model assumes the underlying is a futures or a forward contract., Interest rate options can be valued based on a modified Black futures option model in which the underlying is a forward rate agreement (FRA), there is an accrual period adjustment as well as an underlying notional amount, and that care must be given to day-count conventions., An interest rate cap is a portfolio of interest rate call options termed caplets, each with the same exercise rate and with sequential maturities., An interest rate floor is a portfolio of interest rate put options termed floorlets, each with the same exercise rate and with sequential maturities., A swaption is an option on a swap., A payer swaption is an option on a swap to pay fixed and receive floating., A receiver swaption is an option on a swap to receive fixed and pay floating., Long a callable fixed-rate bond can be viewed as long a straight fixed-rate bond and short a receiver swaption., Delta is a static risk measure defined as the change in a given portfolio for a given small change in the value of the underlying instrument, holding everything else constant., Delta hedging refers to managing the portfolio delta by entering additional positions into the portfolio., A delta neutral portfolio is one in which the portfolio delta is set and maintained at zero., A change in the option price can be estimated with a delta approximation., Because delta is used to make a linear approximation of the non-linear relationship that exists between the option price and the underlying price, there is an error that can be estimated by gamma., Gamma is a static risk measure defined as the change in a given portfolio delta for a given small change in the value of the underlying instrument, holding everything else constant., Gamma captures the non-linearity risk or the risk—via exposure to the underlying—that remains once the portfolio is delta neutral., A gamma neutral portfolio is one in which the portfolio gamma is maintained at zero., The change in the option price can be better estimated by a delta-plus-gamma approximation compared with just a delta approximation., Theta is a static risk measure defined as the change in the value of an option given a small change in calendar time, holding everything else constant., Vega is a static risk measure defined as the change in a given portfolio for a given small change in volatility, holding everything else constant., Rho is a static risk measure defined as the change in a given portfolio for a given small change in the risk-free interest rate, holding everything else constant., Although historical volatility can be estimated, there is no objective measure of future volatility., Implied volatility is the BSM model volatility that yields the market option price., Implied volatility is a measure of future volatility, whereas historical volatility is a measure of past volatility., Option prices reflect the beliefs of option market participant about the future volatility of the underlying., The volatility smile is a two dimensional plot of the implied volatility with respect to the exercise price., The volatility surface is a three dimensional plot of the implied volatility with respect to both expiration time and exercise prices., If the BSM model assumptions were true, then one would expect to find the volatility surface flat, but in practice, the volatility surface is not flat.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level2/level2a/RR_2024_L2V5R2_valuation_of_contingent_claims.pdf,

Each of these sectors has a number of characteristics that are important in determining the supply and demand for each commodity, including ease of storage, geopolitics, and weather., Fundamental analysis of commodities relies on analyzing supply and demand for each of the products as well as estimating the reaction to the inevitable shocks to their equilibrium or underlying direction., The life cycle of commodities varies considerably depending on the economic, technical, and structural (i.e., industry, value chain) profile of each commodity as well as the sector. A short life cycle allows for relatively rapid adjustment to outside events, whereas a long life cycle generally limits the ability of the market to react., The valuation of commodities relative to that of equities and bonds can be summarized by noting that equities and bonds represent financial assets whereas commodities are physical assets. The valuation of commodities is not based on the estimation of future profitability and cash flows but rather on a discounted forecast of future possible prices based on such factors as the supply and demand of the physical item., The commodity trading environment is similar to other asset classes, with three types of trading participants: (1) informed investors/hedgers, (2) speculators, and (3) arbitrageurs., Commodities have two general pricing forms: spot prices in the physical markets and futures prices for later delivery. The spot price is the current price to deliver or purchase a physical commodity at a specific location. A futures price is an exchange-based price agreed on to deliver or receive a defined quantity and often quality of a commodity at a future date., The difference between spot and futures prices is generally called the basis. When the spot price is higher than the futures price, it is called backwardation, and when it is lower, it is called contango. Backwardation and contango are also used to describe the relationship between two futures contracts of the same commodity., Commodity contracts can be settled by either cash or physical delivery., There are three primary theories of futures returns. In insurance theory, commodity producers who are long the physical good are motived to sell the commodity for future delivery to hedge their production price risk exposure. The hedging pressure hypothesis describes when producers along with consumers seek to protect themselves from commodity market price volatility by entering into price hedges to stabilize their projected profits and cash flow. The theory of storage focuses on supply and demand dynamics of commodity inventories, including the concept of “convenience yield.”, In insurance theory, commodity producers who are long the physical good are motived to sell the commodity for future delivery to hedge their production price risk exposure., The hedging pressure hypothesis describes when producers along with consumers seek to protect themselves from commodity market price volatility by entering into price hedges to stabilize their projected profits and cash flow., The theory of storage focuses on supply and demand dynamics of commodity inventories, including the concept of “convenience yield.”, The total return of a fully collateralized commodity futures contract can be quantified as the spot price return plus the roll return plus the collateral return (risk-free rate return)., The roll return is effectively the weighted accounting difference (in percentage terms) between the near-term commodity futures contract price and the farther-term commodity futures contract price., A commodity swap is a legal contract between two parties calling for the exchange of payments over multiple dates as determined by several reference prices or indexes., The most relevant commodity swaps include excess return swaps, total return swaps, basis swaps, and variance/volatility swaps., The five primary commodity indexes based on assets are (1) the S&P GSCI; (2) the Bloomberg Commodity Index, formerly the Dow Jones–UBS Commodity Index; (3) the Deutsche Bank Liquid Commodity Index; (4) the Thomson Reuters/CoreCommodity CRB Index; and (5) the Rogers International Commodities Index., The key differentiating characteristics of commodity indexes are the breadth and selection methodology of coverage (number of commodities and sectors) included in each index, noting that some commodities have multiple reference contracts, the relative weightings assigned to each component/commodity and the related methodology for how these weights are determined, the methodology and frequency for rolling the individual futures contracts, the methodology and frequency for rebalancing the weights of the individual commodities and sectors, and the governance that determines which commodities are selected., the breadth and selection methodology of coverage (number of commodities and sectors) included in each index, noting that some commodities have multiple reference contracts,, the relative weightings assigned to each component/commodity and the related methodology for how these weights are determined,, the methodology and frequency for rolling the individual futures contracts,, the methodology and frequency for rebalancing the weights of the individual commodities and sectors, and, the governance that determines which commodities are selected.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level2/level2a/RR_2024_L2V5R3_intro_commodities_commodity_derivatives.pdf,

One that does not present this subtotal is said to be presented in a single-step format., Revenue is recognized in the period it is earned, which may or may not be in the same period as the related cash collection. Recognition of revenue when earned is a fundamental principal of accrual accounting., An analyst should identify differences in companies’ revenue recognition methods and adjust reported revenue where possible to facilitate comparability. Where the available information does not permit adjustment, an analyst can characterize the revenue recognition as more or less conservative and thus qualitatively assess how differences in policies might affect financial ratios and judgments about profitability., As of the beginning of 2018, revenue recognition standards have converged. The core principle of the converged standards is that revenue should be recognized to “depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in an exchange for those goods or services.”, To achieve the core principle, the standard describes the application of five steps in recognizing revenue. The standard also specifies the treatment of some related contract costs and disclosure requirements., The general principles of expense recognition include a process to match expenses either to revenue (such as, cost of goods sold) or to the time period in which the expenditure occurs (period costs such as, administrative salaries) or to the time period of expected benefits of the expenditures (such as, depreciation)., In expense recognition, choice of method (i.e., depreciation method and inventory cost method), as well as estimates (i.e., uncollectible accounts, warranty expenses, assets’ useful life, and salvage value) affect a company’s reported income. An analyst should identify differences in companies’ expense recognition methods and adjust reported financial statements where possible to facilitate comparability. Where the available information does not permit adjustment, an analyst can characterize the policies and estimates as more or less conservative and thus qualitatively assess how differences in policies might affect financial ratios and judgments about companies’ performance., To assess a company’s future earnings, it is helpful to separate those prior years’ items of income and expense that are likely to continue in the future from those items that are less likely to continue., Under IFRS, a company should present additional line items, headings, and subtotals beyond those specified when such presentation is relevant to an understanding of the entity’s financial performance. Some items from prior years clearly are not expected to continue in future periods and are separately disclosed on a company’s income statement. Under US GAAP, unusual and/or infrequently occurring items, which are material, are presented separately within income from continuing operations., Non-operating items are reported separately from operating items on the income statement. Under both IFRS and US GAAP, the income statement reports separately the effect of the disposal of a component operation as a “discontinued” operation., Basic EPS is the amount of income available to common shareholders divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding over a period. The amount of income available to common shareholders is the amount of net income remaining after preferred dividends (if any) have been paid., If a company has a simple capital structure (i.e., one with no potentially dilutive securities), then its basic EPS is equal to its diluted EPS. If, however, a company has dilutive securities, its diluted EPS is lower than its basic EPS., Diluted EPS is calculated using the if-converted method for convertible securities and the treasury stock method for options., Common-size analysis of the income statement involves stating each line item on the income statement as a percentage of sales. Common-size statements facilitate comparison across time periods and across companies of different sizes., Two income-statement-based indicators of profitability are net profit margin and gross profit margin., Comprehensive income includes both net income and other revenue and expense items that are excluded from the net income calculation.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2023/RR-2023-L1V3R1-understanding-income-statements.pdf,

Market frictions are nil. Short selling is allowed with full use of proceeds. Borrowing and lending are available at a known risk-free rate., Replicating and offsetting instruments are identifiable and investable., Market frictions are nil., Short selling is allowed with full use of proceeds., Borrowing and lending are available at a known risk-free rate., Carry arbitrage models used for forward commitment pricing and valuation are based on the no-arbitrage approach., With forward commitments, there is a distinct difference between pricing and valuation. Pricing involves the determination of the appropriate fixed price or rate, and valuation involves the determination of the contract’s current value expressed in currency units., Forward commitment pricing results in determining a price or rate such that the forward contract value is equal to zero., Using the carry arbitrage model, the forward contract price (F0) is: F0 = FV(S0) = S0(1 + r)T (assuming annual compounding, r) F 0 = FV ( S 0 ) = S 0 exp r c T (assuming continuous compounding, rc ), The key forward commitment pricing equations with carry costs (CC) and carry benefits (CB) are: F0 = FV[S0 + CC0 – CB0] (with discrete compounding) F 0 = S 0 exp ( r c + CC − CB ) T (with continuous compounding)",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level2/level2a/RR_2024_L2V5R1_pricing_valuation_forward_commitments.pdf,

Many view the combination of ownership and control as a fundamental source of the returns earned by the best private equity funds., A critical role for the GP is valuation of potential investments. But because these investments are usually privately owned, valuation encounters many challenges., Valuation techniques differ according to the nature of the investment. Early-stage ventures require very different techniques than leveraged buyouts. Private equity professionals tend to use multiple techniques when performing a valuation, and they explore many different scenarios for the future development of the business., In buyouts, the availability of debt financing can have a big impact on the scale of private equity activity, and it seems to impact valuations observed in the market., Because private equity funds are incentivized to acquire, add value, and then exit within the lifetime of the fund, they are considered buy-to-sell investors. Planning the exit route for the investment is a critical role for the GP, and a well-timed and well-executed investment can be a significant source of realized value., In addition to the problems encountered by the private equity funds in valuing potential portfolio investments, challenges exist in valuing the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis. This is because the investments have no easily observed market value and there is a large element of judgment involved in valuing each of the portfolio companies prior to their sale by the fund., The two main metrics for measuring the ongoing and ultimate performance of private equity funds are IRR and multiples. Comparisons of PE returns across funds and with other assets are demanding because it is important to control for the timing of cash flows, differences in risk and portfolio composition, and vintage-year effects.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2023/RR-2023-L2V5R6-private-equity-investments.pdf,

It is attached to, or embedded in, an underlying option-free bond called a straight bond., Simple embedded option structures include call options, put options, and extension options. Callable and putable bonds can be redeemed prior to maturity, at the discretion of the issuer in the former case and of the bondholder in the latter case. An extendible bond gives the bondholder the right to keep the bond for a number of years after maturity. Putable and extendible bonds are equivalent, except that their underlying option-free bonds are different., Complex embedded option structures include bonds with other types of options or combinations of options. For example, a convertible bond includes a conversion option that allows the bondholders to convert their bonds into the issuer’s common stock. A bond with an estate put can be put by the heirs of a deceased bondholder. Sinking fund bonds make the issuer set aside funds over time to retire the bond issue and are often callable, may have an acceleration provision, and may also contain a delivery option. Valuing and analyzing bonds with complex embedded option structures is challenging., According to the arbitrage-free framework, the value of a bond with an embedded option is equal to the arbitrage-free values of its parts—that is, the arbitrage-free value of the straight bond and the arbitrage-free values of each of the embedded options., Because the call option is an issuer option, the value of the call option decreases the value of the callable bond relative to an otherwise identical but non-callable bond. In contrast, because the put option is an investor option, the value of the put option increases the value of the putable bond relative to an otherwise identical but non-putable bond., In the absence of default and interest rate volatility, the bond’s future cash flows are certain. Thus, the value of a callable or putable bond can be calculated by discounting the bond’s future cash flows at the appropriate one-period forward rates, taking into consideration the decision to exercise the option. If a bond is callable, the decision to exercise the option is made by the issuer, which will exercise the call option when the value of the bond’s future cash flows is higher than the call price. In contrast, if the bond is putable, the decision to exercise the option is made by the bondholder, who will exercise the put option when the value of the bond’s future cash flows is lower than the put price., In practice, interest rates fluctuate and interest rate volatility affects the value of embedded options. Thus, when valuing bonds with embedded options, it is important to consider the possible evolution of the yield curve over time., Interest rate volatility is modeled using a binomial interest rate tree. The higher the volatility, the lower the value of the callable bond and the higher the value of the putable bond., Valuing a bond with embedded options assuming an interest rate volatility requires three steps: (1) Generate a tree of interest rates based on the given yield curve and volatility assumptions; (2) at each node of the tree, determine whether the embedded options will be exercised; and (3) apply the backward induction valuation methodology to calculate the present value of the bond., The option-adjusted spread is the single spread added uniformly to the one-period forward rates on the tree to produce a value or price for a bond. OAS is sensitive to interest rate volatility: The higher the volatility, the lower the OAS for a callable bond., For bonds with embedded options, the best measure to assess the sensitivity of the bond’s price to a parallel shift of the benchmark yield curve is effective duration. The effective duration of a callable or putable bond cannot exceed that of the straight bond., When the option is near the money, the convexity of a callable bond is negative, indicating that the upside for a callable bond is much smaller than the downside, whereas the convexity of a putable bond is positive, indicating that the upside for a putable bond is much larger than the downside., Because the prices of callable and putable bonds respond asymmetrically to upward and downward interest rate changes of the same magnitude, one-sided durations provide a better indication regarding the interest rate sensitivity of bonds with embedded options than (two-sided) effective duration., Key rate durations show the effect of shifting only key points, one at a time, rather than the entire yield curve., The arbitrage-free framework can be used to value capped and floored floaters. The cap provision in a floater is an issuer option that prevents the coupon rate from increasing above a specified maximum rate. Thus, the value of a capped floater is equal to or less than the value of the straight bond. In contrast, the floor provision in a floater is an investor option that prevents the coupon from decreasing below a specified minimum rate. Thus, the value of a floored floater is equal to or higher than the value of the straight bond., The characteristics of a convertible bond include the conversion price, which is the applicable share price at which the bondholders can convert their bonds into common shares, and the conversion ratio, which reflects the number of shares of common stock that the bondholders receive from converting their bonds into shares. The conversion price is adjusted in case of corporate actions, such as stock splits, bonus share issuances, and rights and warrants issuances. Convertible bondholders may receive compensation when the issuer pays dividends to its common shareholders, and they may be given the opportunity to either put their bonds or convert their bonds into shares earlier and at more advantageous terms in the case of a change of control., A number of investment metrics and ratios help analyze and value convertible bonds. The conversion value indicates the value of the bond if it is converted at the market price of the shares. The minimum value of a convertible bond sets a floor value for the convertible bond at the greater of the conversion value or the straight value. This floor is moving, however, because the straight value is not fixed. The market conversion premium represents the price investors effectively pay for the underlying shares if they buy the convertible bond and then convert it into shares. Scaled by the market price of the shares, it represents the premium payable when buying the convertible bond rather than the underlying common stock., Because convertible bonds combine characteristics of bonds, stocks, and options, as well as potentially other features, their valuation and analysis are challenging. Convertible bond investors should consider the factors that affect not only bond prices but also the underlying share price., The arbitrage-free framework can be used to value convertible bonds, including callable and putable ones. Each component (straight bond, call option of the stock, and call and/or put option on the bond) can be valued separately., The risk–return characteristics of a convertible bond depend on the underlying share price relative to the conversion price. When the underlying share price is well below the conversion price, the convertible bond is “busted” and exhibits mostly bond risk–return characteristics. Thus, it is mainly sensitive to interest rate movements. In contrast, when the underlying share price is well above the conversion price, the convertible bond exhibits mostly stock risk–return characteristics. Thus, its price follows similar movements to the price of the underlying stock. In between these two extremes, the convertible bond trades like a hybrid instrument.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level2/level2a/RR_2024_L2V4R7_valuation_analysis_bonds_embedded_options.pdf,

Stock-specific factors may result in a lower value for an equity interest in a private company relative to a public company., Company-specific factors in which private companies differ from public companies include: stage in life cycle; size; overlap of shareholders and management; quality/depth of management; quality of financial and other information; pressure from short-term investors; and tax concerns., stage in life cycle;, size;, overlap of shareholders and management;, quality/depth of management;, quality of financial and other information;, pressure from short-term investors; and, tax concerns., Stock-specific factors that frequently affect the value of private companies include liquidity of equity interests in business; concentration of control; and potential agreements restricting liquidity., liquidity of equity interests in business;, concentration of control; and, potential agreements restricting liquidity., Private company valuations are typically performed for three different reasons: transactions, compliance (financial or tax reporting), or litigation. Acquisition-related valuation issues and financial reporting valuation issues are of greatest importance in assessing public companies., Different definitions (standards) of value exist. The use of a valuation and key elements pertaining to the appraised company will help determine the appropriate definition. Key definitions of value include fair market value; market value; fair value for financial reporting; fair value in a litigation context; investment value; and intrinsic value., fair market value;, market value;, fair value for financial reporting;, fair value in a litigation context;, investment value; and, intrinsic value., Private company valuations may require adjustments to the income statement to develop estimates of the company’s normalized earnings. Adjustments may be required for non-recurring, non-economic, or other unusual items to eliminate anomalies and/or facilitate comparisons., Within the income approach, the FCF method is frequently used to value larger, mature private companies. For smaller companies or in special situations, the capitalized cash flow method and residual income method may also be used., Within the market approach, three methods are regularly used: the guideline public company method, guideline transactions method, and prior transactions method., An asset-based approach is infrequently used in valuing private companies. This approach may be appropriate for companies that are worth more in liquidation than as going concerns. This approach is also applied for asset holding companies, very small companies, or companies formed recently that have limited operating histories., Control and marketability issues are important and challenging elements in the valuation of private companies and equity interests therein., If publicly traded companies are used as the basis for pricing multiple(s), control premiums may be appropriate in measuring the total equity value of a private company. Control premiums have also been used to estimate lack of control discounts., Discounts for lack of control are used to convert a controlling interest value into a non-controlling equity interest value. Evidence of the adverse impact of the lack of control is an important consideration in assessing this discount., Discounts for lack of marketability are often used in valuing non-controlling equity interests in private companies. A DLOM may be inappropriate if the company has a high likelihood of a liquidity event in the immediate future., Quantification of DLOMs can be challenging because of limited data, differences in the interpretation of available data, and different interpretations of the lack of marketability’s effect on a private company., DLOM can be estimated based on 1) private sales of restricted stock in public companies relative to their freely traded share price, 2) private sales of stock in companies prior to a subsequent IPO, and 3) the pricing of put options.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level2/level2a/RR_2024_L2V4R4_private_company_valuation.pdf,

This method involves using a price multiple to evaluate whether an asset is relatively undervalued, fairly valued, or overvalued in relation to a benchmark value of the multiple., The benchmark value of the multiple may be the multiple of a similar company or the median or average value of the multiple for a peer group of companies, an industry, an economic sector, an equity index, or the company’s own median or average past values of the multiple., The economic rationale for the method of comparables is the law of one price., Price multiples may also be applied to valuation in the method based on forecasted fundamentals. Discounted cash flow (DCF) models provide the basis and rationale for this method. Fundamentals also interest analysts who use the method of comparables because differences between a price multiple and its benchmark value may be explained by differences in fundamentals., The key idea behind the use of price-to-earnings ratios (P/Es) is that earning power is a chief driver of investment value and earnings per share (EPS) is probably the primary focus of security analysts’ attention. The EPS figure, however, is frequently subject to distortion, often volatile, and sometimes negative., The two alternative definitions of P/E are trailing P/E, based on the most recent four quarters of EPS, and forward P/E, based on next year’s expected earnings., Analysts address the problem of cyclicality by normalizing EPS—that is, calculating the level of EPS that the business could achieve currently under mid-cyclical conditions (normalized EPS)., Two methods to normalize EPS are the method of historical average EPS (calculated over the most recent full cycle) and the method of average return on equity (EPS = average ROE multiplied by current book value per share)., Earnings yield (E/P) is the reciprocal of the P/E. When stocks have zero or negative EPS, a ranking by earnings yield is meaningful whereas a ranking by P/E is not., Historical trailing P/Es should be calculated with EPS lagged a sufficient amount of time to avoid look-ahead bias. The same principle applies to other multiples calculated on a trailing basis., The fundamental drivers of P/E are the expected earnings growth rate and the required rate of return. The justified P/E based on fundamentals bears a positive relationship to the first factor and an inverse relationship to the second factor., The PEG (P/E-to-growth) ratio is a tool to incorporate the impact of earnings growth on P/E. The PEG ratio is calculated as the ratio of the P/E to the consensus growth forecast. Stocks with low PEG ratios are, all else equal, more attractive than stocks with high PEG ratios., We can estimate terminal value in multistage DCF models by using price multiples based on comparables. The expression for terminal value, Vn , is (using P/E as the example) Vn = Benchmark value of trailing P/E × En or Vn = Benchmark value of forward P/E × En +1., Book value per share is intended to represent, on a per-share basis, the investment that common shareholders have in the company. Inflation, technological change, and accounting distortions, however, may impair the use of book value for this purpose., Book value is calculated as common shareholders’ equity divided by the number of shares outstanding. Analysts adjust book value to accurately reflect the value of the shareholders’ investment and to make P/B (the price-to-book ratio) more useful for comparing different stocks., The fundamental drivers of P/B are ROE and the required rate of return. The justified P/B based on fundamentals bears a positive relationship to the first factor and an inverse relationship to the second factor., An important rationale for using the price-to-sales ratio (P/S) is that sales, as the top line in an income statement, are generally less subject to distortion or manipulation than other fundamentals, such as EPS or book value. Sales are also more stable than earnings and are never negative., P/S fails to take into account differences in cost structure between businesses, may not properly reflect the situation of companies losing money, and may be subject to manipulation through revenue recognition practices., The fundamental drivers of P/S are profit margin, growth rate, and the required rate of return. The justified P/S based on fundamentals bears a positive relationship to the first two factors and an inverse relationship to the third factor., Enterprise value (EV) is total company value (the market value of debt, common equity, and preferred equity) minus the value of cash and investments., The ratio of EV to total sales is conceptually preferable to P/S because EV/S facilitates comparisons among companies with varying capital structures., A key idea behind the use of price to cash flow is that cash flow is less subject to manipulation than are earnings. Price-to-cash-flow multiples are often more stable than P/Es. Some common approximations to cash flow from operations have limitations, however, because they ignore items that may be subject to manipulation., The major cash flow (and related) concepts used in multiples are earnings plus noncash charges (CF), cash flow from operations (CFO), free cash flow to equity (FCFE), and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA)., In calculating price to cash flow, the earnings-plus-noncash-charges concept is traditionally used, although FCFE has the strongest link to financial theory., CF and EBITDA are not strictly cash flow numbers because they do not account for noncash revenue and net changes in working capital., The fundamental drivers of price to cash flow, however defined, are the expected growth rate of future cash flow and the required rate of return. The justified price to cash flow based on fundamentals bears a positive relationship to the first factor and an inverse relationship to the second., EV/EBITDA is preferred to P/EBITDA because EBITDA, as a pre-interest number, is a flow to all providers of capital., EV/EBITDA may be more appropriate than P/E for comparing companies with different amounts of financial leverage (debt)., EV/EBITDA is frequently used in the valuation of capital-intensive businesses., The fundamental drivers of EV/EBITDA are the expected growth rate in free cash flow to the firm, profitability, and the weighted average cost of capital. The justified EV/EBITDA based on fundamentals bears a positive relationship to the first two factors and an inverse relationship to the third., Dividend yield has been used as a valuation indicator because it is a component of total return and is less risky than capital appreciation., Trailing dividend yield is calculated as four times the most recent quarterly per-share dividend divided by the current market price., The fundamental drivers of dividend yield are the expected growth rate in dividends and the required rate of return., Comparing companies across borders frequently involves dealing with differences in accounting standards, cultural differences, economic differences, and resulting differences in risk and growth opportunities., Momentum indicators relate either price or a fundamental to the time series of the price’s or fundamental’s own past values (in some cases, to their expected values)., Momentum valuation indicators include earnings surprise, standardized unexpected earnings (SUE), and relative strength., Unexpected earnings (or earnings surprise) equals the difference between reported earnings and expected earnings., SUE is unexpected earnings divided by the standard deviation in past unexpected earnings., Relative-strength indicators allow comparison of a stock’s performance during a period either with its own past performance (first type) or with the performance of some group of stocks (second type). The rationale for using relative strength is the thesis that patterns of persistence or reversal in returns exist., Screening is the application of a set of criteria to reduce an investment universe to a smaller set of investments and is a part of many stock selection disciplines. In general, limitations of such screens include the lack of control in vendor-provided data of the calculation of important inputs and the absence of qualitative factors.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level2/level2a/RR_2024_L2V4R2_market_based_valuation.pdf,

The emphasis is on generating structure or predictions without human intervention. An elementary way to think of ML algorithms is to “find the pattern, apply the pattern.”, Supervised learning depends on having labeled training data as well as matched sets of observed inputs (X’s, or features) and the associated output (Y, or target). Supervised learning can be divided into two categories: regression and classification. If the target variable to be predicted is continuous, then the task is one of regression. If the target variable is categorical or ordinal (e.g., determining a firm’s rating), then it is a classification problem., With unsupervised learning, algorithms are trained with no labeled data, so they must infer relations between features, summarize them, or present underlying structure in their distributions that has not been explicitly provided. Two important types of problems well suited to unsupervised ML are dimension reduction and clustering., In deep learning, sophisticated algorithms address complex tasks (e.g., image classification, natural language processing). Deep learning is based on neural networks, highly flexible ML algorithms for solving a variety of supervised and unsupervised tasks characterized by large datasets, non-linearities, and interactions among features. In reinforcement learning, a computer learns from interacting with itself or data generated by the same algorithm., Generalization describes the degree to which an ML model retains its explanatory power when predicting out-of-sample. Overfitting, a primary reason for lack of generalization, is the tendency of ML algorithms to tailor models to the training data at the expense of generalization to new data points., Bias error is the degree to which a model fits the training data. Variance error describes how much a model’s results change in response to new data from validation and test samples. Base error is due to randomness in the data. Out-of-sample error equals bias error plus variance error plus base error., K-fold cross-validation is a technique for mitigating the holdout sample problem (excessive reduction of the training set size). The data (excluding test sample and fresh data) are shuffled randomly and then divided into k equal sub-samples, with k – 1 samples used as training samples and one sample, the kth, used as a validation sample., Regularization describes methods that reduce statistical variability in high-dimensional data estimation or prediction problems via reducing model complexity., LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) is a popular type of penalized regression where the penalty term involves summing the absolute values of the regression coefficients., The greater the number of included features, the larger the penalty. So, a feature must make a sufficient contribution to model fit to offset the penalty from including it., Support vector machine (SVM) is a classifier that aims to seek the optimal hyperplane—the one that separates the two sets of data points by the maximum margin (and thus is typically used for classification)., K-nearest neighbor (KNN) is a supervised learning technique most often used for classification. The idea is to classify a new observation by finding similarities (“nearness”) between it and its k-nearest neighbors in the existing dataset., Classification and regression tree (CART) can be applied to predict either a categorical target variable, producing a classification tree, or a continuous target variable, producing a regression tree., A binary CART is a combination of an initial root node, decision nodes, and terminal nodes. The root node and each decision node represent a single feature (f) and a cutoff value (c) for that feature. The CART algorithm iteratively partitions the data into sub-groups until terminal nodes are formed that contain the predicted label., Ensemble learning is a technique of combining the predictions from a collection of models. It typically produces more accurate and more stable predictions than any single model., A random forest classifier is a collection of many different decision trees generated by a bagging method or by randomly reducing the number of features available during training., Principal components analysis (PCA) is an unsupervised ML algorithm that reduces highly correlated features into fewer uncorrelated composite variables by transforming the feature covariance matrix. PCA produces eigenvectors that define the principal components (i.e., the new uncorrelated composite variables) and eigenvalues, which give the proportion of total variance in the initial data that is explained by each eigenvector and its associated principal component., K-means is an unsupervised ML algorithm that partitions observations into a fixed number (k) of non-overlapping clusters. Each cluster is characterized by its centroid, and each observation belongs to the cluster with the centroid to which that observation is closest., Hierarchical clustering is an unsupervised iterative algorithm that is used to build a hierarchy of clusters. Two main strategies are used to define the intermediary clusters (i.e., those clusters between the initial dataset and the final set of clustered data)., Agglomerative (bottom-up) hierarchical clustering begins with each observation being its own cluster. Then, the algorithm finds the two closest clusters, defined by some measure of distance, and combines them into a new, larger cluster. This process is repeated until all observations are clumped into a single cluster., Divisive (top-down) hierarchical clustering starts with all observations belonging to a single cluster. The observations are then divided into two clusters based on some measure of distance. The algorithm then progressively partitions the intermediate clusters into smaller clusters until each cluster contains only one observation., Neural networks consist of nodes connected by links. They have three types of layers: an input layer, hidden layers, and an output layer. Learning takes place in the hidden layer nodes, each of which consists of a summation operator and an activation function. Neural networks have been successfully applied to a variety of investment tasks characterized by non-linearities and complex interactions among variables., Neural networks with many hidden layers (at least 2 but often more than 20) are known as deep neural networks (DNNs) and are the backbone of the artificial intelligence revolution., Reinforcement learning (RL) involves an agent that should perform actions that will maximize its rewards over time, taking into consideration the constraints of its environment.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level2/level2a/RR_2024_L2V1R6_machine_learning.pdf,
Equity Valuation: Applications and Processes,2023 Curriculum,CFA Program Level II,Equity Investments,The member should be able to: define valuation and intrinsic value and explain sources of perceived mispricing; explain the going concern assumption and contrast a going concern value to a liquidation value; describe definitions of value and justify which definition of value is most relevant to public company valuation; describe applications of equity valuation; describe questions that should be addressed in conducting an industry and competitive analysis; contrast absolute and relative valuation models and describe examples of each type of model; describe sum-of-the-parts valuation and conglomerate discounts; explain broad criteria for choosing an appropriate approach for valuing a given company.,The member should be able to: define valuation and intrinsic value and explain sources of perceived mispricing; explain the going concern assumption and contrast a going concern value to a liquidation value; describe definitions of value and justify which definition of value is most relevant to public company valuation; describe applications of equity valuation; describe questions that should be addressed in conducting an industry and competitive analysis; contrast absolute and relative valuation models and describe examples of each type of model; describe sum-of-the-parts valuation and conglomerate discounts; explain broad criteria for choosing an appropriate approach for valuing a given company.,"Valuation is the estimation of an asset’s value based on either variables perceived to be related to future investment returns or comparisons with closely similar assets., The intrinsic value of an asset is its value given a hypothetically complete understanding of the asset’s investment characteristics., The assumption that the market price of a security can diverge from its intrinsic value—as suggested by the rational efficient markets formulation of efficient market theory—underpins active investing., Intrinsic value incorporates the going-concern assumption, that is, the assumption that a company will continue operating for the foreseeable future. In contrast, liquidation value is the company’s value if it were dissolved and its assets sold individually., Fair value is the price at which an asset (or liability) would change hands if neither buyer nor seller were under compulsion to buy/sell and both were informed about material underlying facts., In addition to stock selection by active traders, valuation is also used for: inferring (extracting) market expectations; evaluating corporate events; issuing fairness opinions; evaluating business strategies and models; and appraising private businesses., inferring (extracting) market expectations;, evaluating corporate events;, issuing fairness opinions;, evaluating business strategies and models; and, appraising private businesses., The valuation process has five steps: Understanding the business. Forecasting company performance. Selecting the appropriate valuation model. Converting forecasts to a valuation. Applying the analytical results in the form of recommendations and conclusions., Understanding the business., Forecasting company performance., Selecting the appropriate valuation model., Converting forecasts to a valuation., Applying the analytical results in the form of recommendations and conclusions., Understanding the business includes evaluating industry prospects, competitive position, and corporate strategies—all of which contribute to making more accurate forecasts. Understanding the business also involves analysis of financial reports, including evaluating the quality of a company’s earnings., In forecasting company performance, a top-down forecasting approach moves from macroeconomic forecasts to industry forecasts and then to individual company and asset forecasts. A bottom-up forecasting approach aggregates individual company forecasts to industry forecasts, which in turn may be aggregated to macroeconomic forecasts., Selecting the appropriate valuation approach means choosing an approach that is: consistent with the characteristics of the company being valued; appropriate given the availability and quality of the data; and consistent with the analyst’s valuation purpose and perspective., consistent with the characteristics of the company being valued;, appropriate given the availability and quality of the data; and, consistent with the analyst’s valuation purpose and perspective., Two broad categories of valuation models are absolute valuation models and relative valuation models. Absolute valuation models specify an asset’s intrinsic value, supplying a point estimate of value that can be compared with market price. Present value models of common stock (also called discounted cash flow models) are the most important type of absolute valuation model. Relative valuation models specify an asset’s value relative to the value of another asset. As applied to equity valuation, relative valuation is also known as the method of comparables, which involves comparison of a stock’s price multiple to a benchmark price multiple. The benchmark price multiple can be based on a similar stock or on the average price multiple of some group of stocks., Absolute valuation models specify an asset’s intrinsic value, supplying a point estimate of value that can be compared with market price.

As applied to equity valuation, relative valuation is also known as the method of comparables, which involves comparison of a stock’s price multiple to a benchmark price multiple. The benchmark price multiple can be based on a similar stock or on the average price multiple of some group of stocks., Two important aspects of converting forecasts to valuation are sensitivity analysis and situational adjustments. Sensitivity analysis is an analysis to determine how changes in an assumed input would affect the outcome of an analysis. Situational adjustments include control premiums (premiums for a controlling interest in the company), discounts for lack of marketability (discounts reflecting the lack of a public market for the company’s shares), and illiquidity discounts (discounts reflecting the lack of a liquid market for the company’s shares)., Sensitivity analysis is an analysis to determine how changes in an assumed input would affect the outcome of an analysis., Situational adjustments include control premiums (premiums for a controlling interest in the company), discounts for lack of marketability (discounts reflecting the lack of a public market for the company’s shares), and illiquidity discounts (discounts reflecting the lack of a liquid market for the company’s shares)., Applying valuation conclusions depends on the purpose of the valuation., In performing valuations, analysts must hold themselves accountable to both standards of competence and standards of conduct., An effective research report: contains timely information; is written in clear, incisive language; is objective and well researched, with key assumptions clearly identified; distinguishes clearly between facts and opinions; contains analysis, forecasts, valuation, and a recommendation that are internally consistent; presents sufficient information that the reader can critique the valuation; states the risk factors for an investment in the company; and discloses any potential conflicts of interest faced by the analyst., contains timely information;, is written in clear, incisive language;, is objective and well researched, with key assumptions clearly identified;, distinguishes clearly between facts and opinions;, contains analysis, forecasts, valuation, and a recommendation that are internally consistent;, presents sufficient information that the reader can critique the valuation;, states the risk factors for an investment in the company; and, discloses any potential conflicts of interest faced by the analyst., Analysts have an obligation to provide substantive and meaningful content.

Differences exist in countries’ regulatory requirements for companies to fund defined benefit pension plan obligations., Both IFRS and US GAAP require companies to report on their balance sheet a pension liability or asset equal to the projected benefit obligation minus the fair value of plan assets. The amount of a pension asset that can be reported is subject to a ceiling., Under IFRS, the components of periodic pension cost are recognised as follows: Service cost is recognised in P&L, net interest income/expense is recognised in P&L, and remeasurements are recognised in OCI and are not amortised to future P&L., Under US GAAP, the components of periodic pension cost recognised in P&L include current service costs, interest expense on the pension obligation, and expected returns on plan assets (which reduces the cost). Other components of periodic pension cost—including past service costs, actuarial gains and losses, and differences between expected and actual returns on plan assets—are recognised in OCI and amortised to future P&L., Estimates of the future obligation under defined benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefits are sensitive to numerous assumptions, including discount rates, assumed annual compensation increases, expected return on plan assets, and assumed health care cost inflation., Employee compensation packages are structured to fulfill varied objectives, including satisfying employees’ needs for liquidity, retaining employees, and providing incentives to employees., Common components of employee compensation packages are salary, bonuses, and share-based compensation., Share-based compensation serves to align employees’ interests with those of the shareholders. It includes stocks and stock options., Share-based compensation has the advantage of requiring no current-period cash outlays., Share-based compensation expense is reported at fair value under IFRS and US GAAP., The valuation technique, or option pricing model, that a company uses is an important choice in determining fair value and is disclosed., Key assumptions and input into option pricing models include such items as exercise price, stock price volatility, estimated life of each award, estimated number of options that will be forfeited, dividend yield, and the risk-free rate of interest. Certain assumptions are highly subjective, such as stock price volatility or the expected life of stock options, and can greatly change the estimated fair value and thus compensation expense.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level2/level2a/RR_2024_L2V2R2_employee_compensation_post_employment_share_based.pdf,

Per capita GDP, defined as real GDP divided by population, measures the standard of living in each country., The growth rate of real GDP and the level of per capita real GDP vary widely among countries. As a result, investment opportunities differ by country., Equity markets respond to anticipated growth in earnings. Higher sustainable economic growth should lead to higher earnings growth and equity market valuation ratios, all other things being equal., The best estimate for the long-term growth in earnings for a given country is the estimate of the growth rate in potential GDP., In the long run, the growth rate of earnings cannot exceed the growth in potential GDP. Labor productivity is critical because it affects the level of the upper limit. A permanent increase in productivity growth will raise the upper limit on earnings growth and should translate into faster long-run earnings growth and a corresponding increase in stock price appreciation., For global fixed-income investors, a critical macroeconomic variable is the rate of inflation. One of the best indicators of short- to intermediate-term inflation trends is the difference between the growth rate of actual and potential GDP., Capital deepening, an increase in the capital-to-labor ratio, occurs when the growth rate of capital (net investment) exceeds the growth rate of labor. In a graph of output per capita versus the capital-to-labor ratio, it is reflected by a move along the curve (i.e., the production function)., An increase in total factor productivity causes a proportional upward shift in the entire production function., One method of measuring sustainable growth uses the production function and the growth accounting framework developed by Solow. It arrives at the growth rate of potential GDP by estimating the growth rates of the economy’s capital and labor inputs plus an estimate of total factor productivity., An alternative method measures potential growth as the long-term growth rate of the labor force plus the long-term growth rate of labor productivity., The forces driving economic growth include the quantity and quality of labor and the supply of non-ICT and ICT capital, public capital, raw materials, and technological knowledge., The labor supply is determined by population growth, the labor force participation rate, and net immigration. The physical capital stock in a country increases with net investment. The correlation between long-run economic growth and the rate of investment is high., Technological advances are discoveries that make it possible to produce more or higher-quality goods and services with the same resources or inputs. Technology is a major factor determining TFP. TFP is the main factor affecting long-term, sustainable economic growth rates in developed countries and also includes the cumulative effects of scientific advances, applied research and development, improvements in management methods, and ways of organizing production that raise the productive capacity of factories and offices., Total factor productivity, estimated using a growth accounting equation, is the residual component of growth after accounting for the weighted contributions of all explicit factors (e.g., labor and capital)., Labor productivity is defined as output per worker or per hour worked. Growth in labor productivity depends on capital deepening and technological progress., The academic growth literature is divided into three theories —the classical view, the neoclassical model, and the new endogenous growth view., In the classical model, growth in per capita income is only temporary because an exploding population with limited resources brings per capita income growth to an end., In the neoclassical model, a sustained increase in investment increases the economy’s growth rate only in the short run. Capital is subject to diminishing marginal returns, so long-run growth depends solely on population growth, progress in TFP, and labor’s share of income., The neoclassical model assumes that the production function exhibits diminishing marginal productivity with respect to any individual input., The point at which capital per worker and output per worker are growing at equal, sustainable rates is called the steady state or balanced growth path for the economy. In the steady state, total output grows at the rate of labor force growth plus the rate of growth of TFP divided by the elasticity of output with respect to labor input., The following parameters affect the steady-state values for the capital-to-labor ratio and output per worker: saving rate, labor force growth, growth in TFP, depreciation rate, and elasticity of output with respect to capital., The main criticism of the neoclassical model is that it provides no quantifiable prediction of the rate or form of TFP change. TFP progress is regarded as exogenous to the model., Endogenous growth theory explains technological progress within the model rather than treating it as exogenous. As a result, self-sustaining growth emerges as a natural consequence of the model and the economy does not converge to a steady-state rate of growth that is independent of saving/investment decisions., Unlike the neoclassical model, where increasing capital will result in diminishing marginal returns, the endogenous growth model allows for the possibility of constant or even increasing returns to capital in the aggregate economy., In the endogenous growth model, expenditures made on R&D and for human capital may have large positive externalities or spillover effects. Private spending by companies on knowledge capital generates benefits to the economy as a whole that exceed the private benefit to the company., The convergence hypothesis predicts that the rates of growth of productivity and GDP should be higher in the developing countries. Those higher growth rates imply that the per capita GDP gap between developing and developed economies should narrow over time. The evidence on convergence is mixed., Countries fail to converge because of low rates of investment and savings, lack of property rights, political instability, poor education and health, restrictions on trade, and tax and regulatory policies that discourage work and investing., Opening an economy to financial and trade flows has a major impact on economic growth. The evidence suggests that more open and trade-oriented economies will grow at a faster rate.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level2/level2a/RR_2024_L2V1R10_economic_growth.pdf,

The functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which an entity operates. Normally, the local currency is an entity’s functional currency. For accounting purposes, any currency other than an entity’s functional currency is a foreign currency for that entity. The currency in which financial statement amounts are presented is known as the presentation currency. In most cases, the presentation currency will be the same as the local currency., When an export sale (import purchase) on an account is denominated in a foreign currency, the sales revenue (inventory) and foreign currency account receivable (account payable) are translated into the seller’s (buyer’s) functional currency using the exchange rate on the transaction date. Any change in the functional currency value of the foreign currency account receivable (account payable) that occurs between the transaction date and the settlement date is recognized as a foreign currency transaction gain or loss in net income., If a balance sheet date falls between the transaction date and the settlement date, the foreign currency account receivable (account payable) is translated at the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. The change in the functional currency value of the foreign currency account receivable (account payable) is recognized as a foreign currency transaction gain or loss in income. Analysts should understand that these gains and losses are unrealized at the time they are recognized and might or might not be realized when the transactions are settled., A foreign currency transaction gain arises when an entity has a foreign currency receivable and the foreign currency strengthens or it has a foreign currency payable and the foreign currency weakens. A foreign currency transaction loss arises when an entity has a foreign currency receivable and the foreign currency weakens or it has a foreign currency payable and the foreign currency strengthens., Companies must disclose the net foreign currency gain or loss included in income. They may choose to report foreign currency transaction gains and losses as a component of operating income or as a component of non-operating income. If two companies choose to report foreign currency transaction gains and losses differently, operating profit and operating profit margin might not be directly comparable between the two companies., To prepare consolidated financial statements, foreign currency financial statements of foreign operations must be translated into the parent company’s presentation currency. The major conceptual issues related to this translation process are, What is the appropriate exchange rate for translating each financial statement item, and how should the resulting translation adjustment be reflected in the consolidated financial statements? Two different translation methods are used worldwide., Under the current rate method, assets and liabilities are translated at the current exchange rate, equity items are translated at historical exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated at the exchange rate that existed when the underlying transaction occurred. For practical reasons, an average exchange rate is often used to translate income items., Under the temporal method, monetary assets (and non-monetary assets measured at current value) and monetary liabilities (and non-monetary liabilities measured at current value) are translated at the current exchange rate. Non-monetary assets and liabilities not measured at current value and equity items are translated at historical exchange rates. Revenues and expenses, other than those expenses related to non-monetary assets, are translated at the exchange rate that existed when the underlying transaction occurred. Expenses related to non-monetary assets are translated at the exchange rates used for the related assets., Under both IFRS and US GAAP, the functional currency of a foreign operation determines the method to be used in translating its foreign currency financial statements into the parent’s presentation currency and whether the resulting translation adjustment is recognized in income or as a separate component of equity., The foreign currency financial statements of a foreign operation that has a foreign currency as its functional currency are translated using the current rate method, and the translation adjustment is accumulated as a separate component of equity. The cumulative translation adjustment related to a specific foreign entity is transferred to net income when that entity is sold or otherwise disposed of. The balance sheet risk exposure associated with the current rate method is equal to the foreign subsidiary’s net asset position., The foreign currency financial statements of a foreign operation that has the parent’s presentation currency as its functional currency are translated using the temporal method, and the translation adjustment is included as a gain or loss in income. US GAAP refer to this process as remeasurement. The balance sheet exposure associated with the temporal method is equal to the foreign subsidiary’s net monetary asset/liability position (adjusted for non-monetary items measured at current value)., IFRS and US GAAP differ with respect to the translation of foreign currency financial statements of foreign operations located in a highly inflationary country. Under IFRS, the foreign currency statements are first restated for local inflation and then translated using the current exchange rate. Under US GAAP, the foreign currency financial statements are translated using the temporal method, with no restatement for inflation., Applying different translation methods for a given foreign operation can result in very different amounts reported in the parent’s consolidated financial statements., Companies must disclose the total amount of translation gain or loss reported in income and the amount of translation adjustment included in a separate component of stockholders’ equity. Companies are not required to separately disclose the component of translation gain or loss arising from foreign currency transactions and the component arising from application of the temporal method., Disclosures related to translation adjustments reported in equity can be used to include these as gains and losses in determining an adjusted amount of income following a clean-surplus approach to income measurement., Foreign currency translation rules are well established in both IFRS and US GAAP. Fortunately, except for the treatment of foreign operations located in highly inflationary countries, the two sets of standards have no major differences in this area. The ability to understand the impact of foreign currency translation on the financial results of a company using IFRS should apply equally well in the analysis of financial statements prepared in accordance with US GAAP., An analyst can obtain information about the tax impact of multinational operations from companies’ disclosure on effective tax rates., For a multinational company, sales growth is driven not only by changes in volume and price but also by changes in the exchange rates between the reporting currency and the currency in which sales are made. Arguably, growth in sales that comes from changes in volume or price is more sustainable than growth in sales that comes from changes in exchange rates.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level2/level2a/RR_2024_L2V2R3_multinational_operations.pdf,

IFRS and US GAAP treat investments in financial assets in a similar manner., Fair value through profit or loss., Fair value through other comprehensive income., Amortized cost., Investments in associates and joint ventures are those in which the investor has significant influence, but not control, over the investee’s business activities. Because the investor can exert significant influence over financial and operating policy decisions, IFRS and US GAAP require the equity method of accounting because it provides a more objective basis for reporting investment income. The equity method requires the investor to recognize income as earned rather than when dividends are received. The equity investment is carried at cost, plus its share of post-acquisition income (after adjustments) less dividends received. The equity investment is reported as a single line item on the balance sheet and on the income statement., The equity method requires the investor to recognize income as earned rather than when dividends are received., The equity investment is carried at cost, plus its share of post-acquisition income (after adjustments) less dividends received., The equity investment is reported as a single line item on the balance sheet and on the income statement., IFRS and US GAAP accounting standards require the use of the acquisition method to account for business combinations. Fair value of the consideration given is the appropriate measurement for identifiable assets and liabilities acquired in the business combination., Goodwill is the difference between the acquisition value and the fair value of the target’s identifiable net tangible and intangible assets. Because it is considered to have an indefinite life, it is not amortized. Instead, it is evaluated at least annually for impairment. Impairment losses are reported on the income statement. IFRS use a one-step approach to determine and measure the impairment loss, whereas US GAAP uses a two-step approach., If the acquiring company acquires less than 100%, non-controlling (minority) shareholders’ interests are reported on the consolidated financial statements.

For infinitely lived assets such as common stocks, n runs to infinity., Several alternative streams of expected cash flows can be used to value equities, including dividends, free cash flow, and residual income. A discounted dividend approach is most suitable for dividend-paying stocks in which the company has a discernible dividend policy that has an understandable relationship to the company’s profitability and the investor has a non-control (minority ownership) perspective., The free cash flow approach (FCFF or FCFE) might be appropriate when the company does not pay dividends, dividends differ substantially from FCFE, free cash flows align with profitability, or the investor takes a control (majority ownership) perspective., The residual income approach can be useful when the company does not pay dividends (as an alternative to a FCF approach) or free cash flow is negative., The DDM with a single holding period gives stock value as V 0 = D 1 ( 1 + r ) 1 + P 1 ( 1 + r ) 1 = D 1 + P 1 ( 1 + r ) 1 , where D 1 is the expected dividend at Time 1 and V 0 is the stock’s (expected) value at Time 0. Assuming that V 0 is equal to today’s market price, P 0, the expected holding-period return is r = D 1 + P 1 P 0 − 1 = D 1 P 0 + P 1 − P 0 P 0 ., The expression for the DDM for any given finite holding period n and the general expression for the DDM are, respectively, V 0 = ∑ t = 1 n D t ( 1 + r ) t + P n ( 1 + r ) n and V 0 = ∑ t = 1 ∞ D t ( 1 + r ) t ., There are two main approaches to the problem of forecasting dividends. First, an analyst can assign the entire stream of expected future dividends to one of several stylized growth patterns. Second, an analyst can forecast a finite number of dividends individually up to a terminal point and value the remaining dividends either by assigning them to a stylized growth pattern or by forecasting share price as of the terminal point of the dividend forecasts., The Gordon growth model assumes that dividends grow at a constant rate g forever, so that Dt = Dt– 1(1 + g). The dividend stream in the Gordon growth model has a value of V 0 = D 0 ( 1 + g ) r − g , or V 0 = D 1 r − g where r > g ., The value of non-callable fixed-rate perpetual preferred stock is V 0 = D/r, where D is the stock’s (constant) annual dividend., Assuming that price equals value, the Gordon growth model estimate of a stock’s expected rate of return is r = D 0 ( 1 + g ) P 0 + g = D 1 P 0 + g ., Given an estimate of the next-period dividend and the stock’s required rate of return, the Gordon growth model can be used to estimate the dividend growth rate implied by the current market price (making a constant growth rate assumption)., The present value of growth opportunities is the part of a stock’s total value, V 0, that comes from profitable future growth opportunities in contrast to the value associated with assets already in place. The relationship is V 0 = E 1/r + PVGO, where E 1/r is defined as the no-growth value per share., The leading price-to-earnings ratio (P 0/E 1) and the trailing price-to-earnings ratio (P 0/E 0) can be expressed in terms of the Gordon growth model as, respectively, P 0 E 1 = D 1 / E 1 r − g = 1 − b r − g and P 0 E 0 = D 0 ( 1 + g ) / E 0 r − g = ( 1 − b ) ( 1 + g ) r − g . The foregoing expressions give a stock’s justified price-to-earnings ratio based on forecasts of fundamentals (given that the Gordon growth model is appropriate)., The Gordon growth model may be useful for valuing broad-based equity indexes and the stock of businesses with earnings that are expected to grow at a stable rate comparable to or lower than the economy’s nominal growth rate., Gordon growth model values are very sensitive to the assumed growth rate and required rate of return., For many companies, growth falls into phases. In the growth phase, a company enjoys an abnormally high growth rate in earnings per share, called supernormal growth. In the transition phase, earnings growth slows. In the mature phase, the company reaches an equilibrium in which such factors as earnings growth and the return on equity stabilize at levels that can be sustained long term. Analysts often apply multistage DCF models to value the stock of a company with multistage growth prospects., The two-stage dividend discount model assumes different growth rates in Stage 1 and Stage 2: V 0 = ∑ t = 1 n D 0 ( 1 + g S ) t ( 1 + r ) t + D 0 ( 1 + g S ) n ( 1 + g L ) ( 1 + r ) n ( r − g L ) , where gS is the expected dividend growth rate in the first period and gL is the expected growth rate in the second period., The terminal stock value, Vn , is sometimes found with the Gordon growth model or with some other method, such as applying a P/E multiplier to forecasted EPS as of the terminal date., The H-model assumes that the dividend growth rate declines linearly from a high supernormal rate to the normal growth rate during Stage 1 and then grows at a constant normal growth rate thereafter: V 0 = D 0 ( 1 + g L ) r − g L + D 0 H ( g S − g L ) r − g L = D 0 ( 1 + g L ) + D 0 H ( g S − g L ) r − g L ., There are two basic three-stage models. In one version, the growth rate in the middle stage is constant. In the second version, the growth rate declines linearly in Stage 2 and becomes constant and normal in Stage 3., In addition to valuing equities, the IRR of a DDM, assuming assets are correctly priced in the marketplace, has been used to estimate required returns. For simpler models (such as the one-period model, the Gordon growth model, and the H-model), well-known formulas may be used to calculate these rates of return. For many dividend streams, however, the rate of return must be found by trial and error, producing a discount rate that equates the present value of the forecasted dividend stream to the current market price., Multistage DDM models can accommodate a wide variety of patterns of expected dividends. Even though such models may use stylized assumptions about growth, they can provide useful approximations., Dividend growth rates can be obtained from analyst forecasts, statistical forecasting models, or company fundamentals. The sustainable growth rate depends on the ROE and the earnings retention rate, b: g = b × ROE. This expression can be expanded further, using the DuPont formula, as g = Net income − Dividends Net income × Net income Sales × Sales Total assets × Total assets Shareholders' equity .",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level2/level2a/RR_2024_L2V3R6_discounted_dividend_valuation.pdf,

The deduction, called the equity charge, is equal to equity capital multiplied by the required rate of return on equity (the cost of equity capital in percent)., Economic value added (EVA) is a commercial implementation of the residual income concept. EVA = NOPAT − (C% × TC), where NOPAT is net operating profit after taxes, C% is the percent cost of capital, and TC is total capital., Residual income models (including commercial implementations) are used not only for equity valuation but also to measure internal corporate performance and for determining executive compensation., We can forecast per-share residual income as forecasted earnings per share minus the required rate of return on equity multiplied by beginning book value per share. Alternatively, per-share residual income can be forecasted as beginning book value per share multiplied by the difference between forecasted ROE and the required rate of return on equity., In the residual income model, the intrinsic value of a share of common stock is the sum of book value per share and the present value of expected future per-share residual income. In the residual income model, the equivalent mathematical expressions for intrinsic value of a common stock are V 0 = B 0 + ∑ t = 1 ∞ RI t ( 1 + r ) t = B 0 + ∑ t = 1 ∞ E t − r B t − 1 ( 1 + r ) t = B 0 + ∑ t = 1 ∞ ( ROE t − r ) B t − 1 ( 1 + r ) t where",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level2/level2a/RR_2024_L2V4R3_residual_income_valuation.pdf,

The value of equity is the value of the firm minus the value of the firm’s debt: Equity value = Firm value – Market value of debt. Dividing the total value of equity by the number of outstanding shares gives the value per share. The WACC formula is WACC = MV ( Debt ) MV ( Debt ) + MV ( Equity ) r d ( 1 − Tax rate ) + MV(Equity) MV ( Debt ) + MV ( Equity ) r ., The value of the firm if FCFF is growing at a constant rate is Firm value = FCFF 1 WACC − g = FCFF 0 ( 1 + g ) WACC − g ., With the FCFE valuation approach, the value of equity can be found by discounting FCFE at the required rate of return on equity, r: Equity value = ∑ t = 1 ∞ FCFE t ( 1 + r ) t . Dividing the total value of equity by the number of outstanding shares gives the value per share., The value of equity if FCFE is growing at a constant rate is Equity value = FCFE 1 r − g = FCFE 0 ( 1 + g ) r − g ., FCFF and FCFE are frequently calculated by starting with net income: FCFF = NI + NCC + Int(1 – Tax rate) – FCInv – WCInv. FCFE = NI + NCC – FCInv – WCInv + Net borrowing., FCFF and FCFE are related to each other as follows: FCFE = FCFF – Int(1 – Tax rate) + Net borrowing., FCFF and FCFE can be calculated by starting from cash flow from operations: FCFF = CFO + Int(1 – Tax rate) – FCInv. FCFE = CFO – FCInv + Net borrowing., FCFF can also be calculated from EBIT or EBITDA: FCFF = EBIT(1 – Tax rate) + Dep – FCInv – WCInv. FCFF = EBITDA(1 – Tax rate) + Dep(Tax rate) – FCInv – WCInv. FCFE can then be found by using FCFE = FCFF – Int(1 – Tax rate) + Net borrowing., Finding CFO, FCFF, and FCFE may require careful interpretation of corporate financial statements. In some cases, the necessary information may not be transparent., Earnings components such as net income, EBIT, EBITDA, and CFO should not be used as cash flow measures to value a firm. These earnings components either double-count or ignore parts of the cash flow stream., FCFF or FCFE valuation expressions can be easily adapted to accommodate complicated capital structures, such as those that include preferred stock., A general expression for the two-stage FCFF valuation model is Firm value = ∑ t = 1 n FCFF t ( 1 + WACC ) t + FCFF n + 1 ( WACC − g ) 1 ( 1 + WACC ) n ., A general expression for the two-stage FCFE valuation model is Equity value = ∑ t = 1 n FCFE t ( 1 + r ) t + ( FCFE n + 1 r − g ) [ 1 ( 1 + r ) n ] ., One common two-stage model assumes a constant growth rate in each stage, and a second common model assumes declining growth in Stage 1 followed by a long-run sustainable growth rate in Stage 2., To forecast FCFF and FCFE, analysts build a variety of models of varying complexity. A common approach is to forecast sales, with profitability, investments, and financing derived from changes in sales., Three-stage models are often considered to be good approximations for cash flow streams that, in reality, fluctuate from year to year., Non-operating assets, such as excess cash and marketable securities, noncurrent investment securities, and nonperforming assets, are usually segregated from the company’s operating assets. They are valued separately and then added to the value of the company’s operating assets to find total firm value.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level2/level2a/RR_2024_L2V4R1_free_cash_flow_valuation.pdf,

Forward exchange rates apply to trades to be settled at any longer maturity., Market makers quote bid and offer prices (in terms of the price currency) at which they will buy or sell the base currency. The offer price is always higher than the bid price. The counterparty that asks for a two-sided price quote has the option (but not the obligation) to deal at either the bid or offer price quoted. The bid–offer spread depends on (1) the currency pair involved, (2) the time of day, (3) market volatility, (4) the transaction size, and (5) the relationship between the dealer and the client. Spreads are tightest in highly liquid currency pairs, when the key market centers are open, and when market volatility is relatively low., The offer price is always higher than the bid price., The counterparty that asks for a two-sided price quote has the option (but not the obligation) to deal at either the bid or offer price quoted., The bid–offer spread depends on (1) the currency pair involved, (2) the time of day, (3) market volatility, (4) the transaction size, and (5) the relationship between the dealer and the client.

The cross-rate bids (offers) posted by a dealer must be lower (higher) than the implied cross-rate offers (bids) available in the interbank market. If they are not, then a triangular arbitrage opportunity arises., The bid (offer) shown by a dealer in the interbank market cannot be higher (lower) than the current interbank offer (bid) price., The cross-rate bids (offers) posted by a dealer must be lower (higher) than the implied cross-rate offers (bids) available in the interbank market. If they are not, then a triangular arbitrage opportunity arises., Forward exchange rates are quoted in terms of points to be added to the spot exchange rate. If the points are positive (negative), the base currency is trading at a forward premium (discount). The points are proportional to the interest rate differential and approximately proportional to the time to maturity., International parity conditions show us how expected inflation, interest rate differentials, forward exchange rates, and expected future spot exchange rates are linked. In an ideal world, relative expected inflation rates should determine relative nominal interest rates, relative interest rates should determine forward exchange rates, and forward exchange rates should correctly anticipate the path of the future spot exchange rate., relative expected inflation rates should determine relative nominal interest rates,, relative interest rates should determine forward exchange rates, and, forward exchange rates should correctly anticipate the path of the future spot exchange rate., International parity conditions tell us that countries with high (low) expected inflation rates should see their currencies depreciate (appreciate) over time, that high-yield currencies should depreciate relative to low-yield currencies over time, and that forward exchange rates should function as unbiased predictors of future spot exchange rates., With the exception of covered interest rate parity, which is enforced by arbitrage, the key international parity conditions rarely hold in either the short or medium term. However, the parity conditions tend to hold over relatively long horizons., According to the theory of covered interest rate parity, a foreign-currency-denominated money market investment that is completely hedged against exchange rate risk in the forward market should yield exactly the same return as an otherwise identical domestic money market investment., According to the theory of uncovered interest rate parity, the expected change in a domestic currency’s value should be fully reflected in domestic–foreign interest rate spreads. Hence, an unhedged foreign-currency-denominated money market investment is expected to yield the same return as an otherwise identical domestic money market investment., According to the ex ante purchasing power parity condition, expected changes in exchange rates should equal the difference in expected national inflation rates., If both ex ante purchasing power parity and uncovered interest rate parity held, real interest rates across all markets would be the same. This result is real interest rate parity., The international Fisher effect says that the nominal interest rate differential between two currencies equals the difference between the expected inflation rates. The international Fisher effect assumes that risk premiums are the same throughout the world., If both covered and uncovered interest rate parity held, then forward rate parity would hold and the market would set the forward exchange rate equal to the expected spot exchange rate: The forward exchange rate would serve as an unbiased predictor of the future spot exchange rate., Most studies have found that high-yield currencies do not depreciate and low-yield currencies do not appreciate as much as yield spreads would suggest over short to medium periods, thus violating the theory of uncovered interest rate parity., Carry trades overweight high-yield currencies at the expense of low-yield currencies. Historically, carry trades have generated attractive returns in benign market conditions but tend to perform poorly (i.e., are subject to crash risk) when market conditions are highly volatile., According to a balance of payments approach, countries that run persistent current account deficits will generally see their currencies weaken over time. Similarly, countries that run persistent current account surpluses will tend to see their currencies appreciate over time., Large current account imbalances can persist for long periods of time before they trigger an adjustment in exchange rates., Greater financial integration of the world’s capital markets and greater freedom of capital to flow across national borders have increased the importance of global capital flows in determining exchange rates., Countries that institute relatively tight monetary policies, introduce structural economic reforms, and lower budget deficits will often see their currencies strengthen over time as capital flows respond positively to relatively high nominal interest rates, lower inflation expectations, a lower risk premium, and an upward revision in the market’s assessment of what exchange rate level constitutes long-run fair value., Monetary policy affects the exchange rate through a variety of channels. In the Mundell–Fleming model, it does so primarily through the interest rate sensitivity of capital flows, strengthening the currency when monetary policy is tightened and weakening it when monetary policy is eased. The more sensitive capital flows are to the change in interest rates, the greater the exchange rate’s responsiveness to the change in monetary policy., In the monetary model of exchange rate determination, monetary policy is deemed to have a direct impact on the actual and expected path of inflation, which, via purchasing power parity, translates into a corresponding impact on the exchange rate., Countries that pursue overly easy monetary policies will see their currencies depreciate over time., In the Mundell–Fleming model, an expansionary fiscal policy typically results in a rise in domestic interest rates and an increase in economic activity. The rise in domestic interest rates should induce a capital inflow, which is positive for the domestic currency, but the rise in economic activity should contribute to a deterioration of the trade balance, which is negative for the domestic currency. The more mobile capital flows are, the greater the likelihood that the induced inflow of capital will dominate the deterioration in trade., Under conditions of high capital mobility, countries that simultaneously pursue expansionary fiscal policies and relatively tight monetary policies should see their currencies strengthen over time., The portfolio balance model of exchange rate determination asserts that increases in government debt resulting from a rising budget deficit will be willingly held by investors only if they are compensated in the form of a higher expected return. The higher expected return could come from (1) higher interest rates and/or a higher risk premium, (2) depreciation of the currency to a level sufficient to generate anticipation of gains from subsequent currency appreciation, or (3) some combination of the two., Surges in capital inflows can fuel boom-like conditions, asset price bubbles, and currency overvaluation., Many consider capital controls to be a legitimate part of a policymaker’s toolkit. The IMF believes that capital controls may be needed to prevent exchange rates from overshooting, asset price bubbles from forming, and future financial conditions from deteriorating., The evidence indicates that government policies have had a significant impact on the course of exchange rates. Relative to developed countries, emerging markets may have greater success in managing their exchange rates because of their large foreign exchange reserve holdings, which appear sizable relative to the limited turnover of FX transactions in many emerging markets., Although each currency crisis is distinct in some respects, the following factors were identified in one or more studies: Prior to a currency crisis, the capital markets have been liberalized to allow the free flow of capital. There are large inflows of foreign capital (relative to GDP) in the period leading up to a crisis, with short-term funding denominated in a foreign currency being particularly problematic. Currency crises are often preceded by (and often coincide with) banking crises. Countries with fixed or partially fixed exchange rates are more susceptible to currency crises than countries with floating exchange rates. Foreign exchange reserves tend to decline precipitously as a crisis approaches. In the period leading up to a crisis, the currency has risen substantially relative to its historical mean. The terms of trade (exports relative to imports) often deteriorate before a crisis. Broad money growth and the ratio of M2 (a measure of money supply) to bank reserves tend to rise prior to a crisis. Inflation tends to be significantly higher in pre-crisis periods compared with tranquil periods., Prior to a currency crisis, the capital markets have been liberalized to allow the free flow of capital., There are large inflows of foreign capital (relative to GDP) in the period leading up to a crisis, with short-term funding denominated in a foreign currency being particularly problematic., Currency crises are often preceded by (and often coincide with) banking crises., Countries with fixed or partially fixed exchange rates are more susceptible to currency crises than countries with floating exchange rates., Foreign exchange reserves tend to decline precipitously as a crisis approaches., In the period leading up to a crisis, the currency has risen substantially relative to its historical mean., The terms of trade (exports relative to imports) often deteriorate before a crisis., Broad money growth and the ratio of M2 (a measure of money supply) to bank reserves tend to rise prior to a crisis., Inflation tends to be significantly higher in pre-crisis periods compared with tranquil periods.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level2/level2a/RR_2024_L2V1R9_currency_exchange_rates_equilibrium_value.pdf,

Regulation is expected to have societal benefits and should be assessed using cost–benefit analysis., The regulation of securities markets and financial institutions is extensive and complex because of the consequences of failures in the financial system. These consequences include financial losses, loss of confidence, and disruption of commerce., The focus of regulators in financial markets includes prudential supervision, financial stability, market integrity, and economic growth., Regulatory competition is competition among different regulatory bodies to use regulation in order to attract certain entities., The breadth of regulation of commerce necessitates the use of a framework that identifies potential areas of regulation. This framework can be referenced to identify specific areas of regulation, both existing and anticipated, that may affect the entity of interest., Legislative bodies, regulatory bodies, and courts typically enact regulation., Regulatory bodies include government agencies and independent regulators granted authority by a government or governmental agency. Some independent regulators are self-regulating organizations., Typically, legislative bodies enact broad laws or statutes. Regulatory bodies issue administrative regulations, often implementing statutes. Courts interpret statutes and administrative regulations; these interpretations may result in judicial law., Interdependence in the actions and potentially conflicting objectives of regulators is an important consideration for regulators, regulated entities, and those assessing the effects of regulation., Regulation that arises to enhance the interests of regulated entities reflects regulatory capture., Regulators have responsibility for both substantive and procedural laws. The former focuses on rights and responsibilities of entities and relationships among entities. The latter focuses on the protection and enforcement of the former., Regulatory arbitrage is the use of regulation by an entity to exploit differences in economic substance and regulatory interpretation or in regulatory regimes to the entity’s benefit., There are many regulatory tools available to regulators, including regulatory mandates and restrictions on behaviors, provision of public goods, and public financing of private projects., The choice of regulatory tool should be consistent with maintaining a stable regulatory environment. “Stable” does not mean unchanging but, rather, refers to desirable attributes of regulation, including predictability, effectiveness in achieving objectives, time consistency, and enforceability., In assessing regulation and regulatory outcomes, regulators should conduct ongoing cost–benefit analyses, develop techniques to enhance the measurement of these outcomes, and use economic principles to guide them., Net regulatory burden to the entity of interest is an important consideration for analysts.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level2/level2a/RR_2024_L2V1R11_economics_of_regulation.pdf,

This dynamic implies an expected return in excess of short-maturity bonds (i.e., a term premium) for longer-maturity bonds if the yield curve is upward sloping., Active bond portfolio management is consistent with the expectation that today’s forward curve does not accurately reflect future spot rates., The swap curve provides another measure of the time value of money., Swaps are an essential tool frequently used by investors to hedge, take a position in, or otherwise modify interest rate risk., Bond quote conventions often use measures of spreads. Those quoted spreads can be used to determine a bond’s price., Swap curves and Treasury curves can differ because of differences in their credit exposures, liquidity, and other supply/demand factors., Market participants often use interest rate spreads between short-term government and risky rates as a barometer to evaluate relative credit and liquidity risk., The local expectations theory, liquidity preference theory, segmented markets theory, and preferred habitat theory provide traditional explanations for the shape of the yield curve., Historical yield curve movements suggest that they can be explained by a linear combination of three principal movements: level, steepness, and curvature., The volatility term structure can be measured using historical data and depicts yield curve risk. The sensitivity of a bond value to yield curve changes may make use of effective duration, key rate durations, or sensitivities to parallel, steepness, and curvature movements. Using key rate durations or sensitivities to parallel, steepness, and curvature movements allows one to measure and manage shaping risk., The term bond risk premium refers to the expected excess return of a default-free long-term bond less that of an equivalent short-term bond or the one-period risk-free rate, Several macroeconomic factors influence bond pricing and required returns such as inflation, economic growth, and monetary policy, among others., During highly uncertain market periods, investors flock to government bonds in a flight to quality that is often associated with bullish flattening, in which long-term rates fall by more than short-term rates., Investors expecting rates to fall will generally extend (shorten) portfolio duration to take advantage of expected bond price increases (decreases), When investors expect a steeper (flatter) curve under which long-term rates rise (fall) relative to short-term rates, they will sell (buy) long-term bonds and purchase (sell) short-term bonds.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level2/level2a/RR_2024_L2V4R5_term_structure_interest_rate_dynamics.pdf,

Concentrated corporate ownership reflects an individual shareholder or a group (controlling shareholders) with the ability to exercise control over the corporation., Controlling shareholders may be either majority shareholders or minority shareholders., Horizontal ownership involves companies with mutual business interests that have cross-holding share arrangements with each other. Vertical (or pyramid) ownership involves a company or group that has a controlling interest in two or more holding companies, which in turn have controlling interests in various operating companies., Dual-class (or multiple-class) shares grant one or more share classes superior or even sole voting rights while other share classes have inferior or no voting rights., Types of influential owners include banks, families, sovereign governments, institutional investors, group companies, private equity firms, foreign investors, managers, and board directors., A corporation’s board of directors is typically structured as either one tier or two tier. A one-tier board consists of a single board of directors, composed of executive (internal) and non-executive (external) directors. A two-tier board consists of a supervisory board that oversees a management board., CEO duality exists when the chief executive officer also serves as chairperson of the board., A primary challenge of integrating ESG factors into investment analysis is identifying and obtaining information that is relevant, comparable, and decision-useful., ESG information and metrics are inconsistently reported by companies, and such disclosure is voluntary, which provides additional challenges for analysts., In an ESG context, materiality typically refers to ESG-related issues that are expected to affect a company’s operations or financial performance and the valuation of its securities., Corporate governance considerations, such as the structure of the board of directors, tend to be reasonably consistent across most companies. In contrast, environmental and social considerations often differ greatly., Analysts typically use three main sources of information to identify a company’s (or industry’s) ESG factors: (1) proprietary research, (2) ratings and analysis from ESG data providers, or (3) research from not-for-profit industry organizations and initiatives., In equity analysis, ESG integration is used to both identify potential opportunities and mitigate downside risk, whereas in fixed-income analysis, ESG integration is generally focused on mitigating downside risk., A typical starting point for ESG integration is the identification of material qualitative and quantitative ESG factors that pertain to a company or its industry.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level2/level2a/RR_2024_L2V3R2_esg_considerations_in_investment_analysis.pdf,

The product of the two is expected loss. Investors in higher-quality bonds tend not to focus on loss severity because default risk for those securities is low., Loss severity equals (1 – Recovery rate)., Credit-related risks include downgrade risk (also called credit migration risk) and market liquidity risk. Either of these can cause yield spreads—yield premiums—to rise and bond prices to fall., Downgrade risk refers to a decline in an issuer’s creditworthiness. Downgrades will cause its bonds to trade with wider yield spreads and thus lower prices., Market liquidity risk refers to a widening of the bid–ask spread on an issuer’s bonds. Lower-quality bonds tend to have greater market liquidity risk than higher-quality bonds, and during times of market or financial stress, market liquidity risk rises., The composition of an issuer’s debt and equity is referred to as its “capital structure.” Debt ranks ahead of all types of equity with respect to priority of payment, and within the debt component of the capital structure, there can be varying levels of seniority., With respect to priority of claims, secured debt ranks ahead of unsecured debt, and within unsecured debt, senior debt ranks ahead of subordinated debt. In the typical case, all of an issuer’s bonds have the same probability of default due to cross-default provisions in most indentures. Higher priority of claim implies higher recovery rate—lower loss severity—in the event of default., For issuers with more complex corporate structures—for example, a parent holding company that has operating subsidiaries—debt at the holding company is structurally subordinated to the subsidiary debt, although the possibility of more diverse assets and earnings streams from other sources could still result in the parent having higher effective credit quality than a particular subsidiary., Recovery rates can vary greatly by issuer and industry. They are influenced by the composition of an issuer’s capital structure, where in the economic and credit cycle the default occurred, and what the market’s view of the future prospects are for the issuer and its industry., The priority of claims in bankruptcy is not always absolute. It can be influenced by several factors, including some leeway accorded to bankruptcy judges, government involvement, or a desire on the part of the more senior creditors to settle with the more junior creditors and allow the issuer to emerge from bankruptcy as a going concern, rather than risking smaller and delayed recovery in the event of a liquidation of the borrower., Credit rating agencies, such as Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s, and Fitch, play a central role in the credit markets. Nearly every bond issued in the broad debt markets carries credit ratings, which are opinions about a bond issue’s creditworthiness. Credit ratings enable investors to compare the credit risk of debt issues and issuers within a given industry, across industries, and across geographic markets., Bonds rated Aaa to Baa3 by Moody’s and AAA to BBB– by Standard & Poor’s (S&P) and/or Fitch (higher to lower) are referred to as “investment grade.” Bonds rated lower than that—Ba1 or lower by Moody’s and BB+ or lower by S&P and/or Fitch—are referred to as “below investment grade” or “speculative grade.” Below-investment-grade bonds are also called “high-yield” or “junk” bonds., The rating agencies rate both issuers and issues. Issuer ratings are meant to address an issuer’s overall creditworthiness—its risk of default. Ratings for issues incorporate such factors as their rankings in the capital structure., The rating agencies will notch issue ratings up or down to account for such factors as capital structure ranking for secured or subordinated bonds, reflecting different recovery rates in the event of default. Ratings may also be notched due to structural subordination., There are risks in relying too much on credit agency ratings. Creditworthiness may change over time, and initial/current ratings do not necessarily reflect the creditworthiness of an issuer or bond over an investor’s holding period. Valuations often adjust before ratings change, and the notching process may not adequately reflect the price decline of a bond that is lower ranked in the capital structure. Because ratings primarily reflect the probability of default but not necessarily the severity of loss given default, bonds with the same rating may have significantly different expected losses (default probability times loss severity). And like analysts, credit rating agencies may have difficulty forecasting certain credit-negative outcomes, such as adverse litigation, leveraging corporate transactions, and such low probability/high severity events as earthquakes and hurricanes., The role of corporate credit analysis is to assess the company’s ability to make timely payments of interest and to repay principal at maturity., Credit analysis is similar to equity analysis. It is important to understand, however, that bonds are contracts and that management’s duty to bondholders and other creditors is limited to the terms of the contract. In contrast, management’s duty to shareholders is to act in their best interest by trying to maximize the value of the company—perhaps even at the expense of bondholders at times., Credit analysts tend to focus more on the downside risk given the asymmetry of risk/return, whereas equity analysts focus more on upside opportunity from earnings growth, and so on., The “4 Cs” of credit—capacity, collateral, covenants, and character—provide a useful framework for evaluating credit risk., Credit analysis focuses on an issuer’s ability to generate cash flow. The analysis starts with an industry assessment—structure and fundamentals—and continues with an analysis of an issuer’s competitive position, management strategy, and track record., Credit measures are used to calculate an issuer’s creditworthiness, as well as to compare its credit quality with peer companies. Key credit ratios focus on leverage and interest coverage and use such measures as EBITDA, free cash flow, funds from operations, interest expense and balance sheet debt., An issuer’s ability to access liquidity is also an important consideration in credit analysis., The higher the credit risk, the greater the offered/required yield and potential return demanded by investors. Over time, bonds with more credit risk offer higher returns but with greater volatility of return than bonds with lower credit risk., The yield on a credit-risky bond comprises the yield on a default risk–free bond with a comparable maturity plus a yield premium, or “spread,” that comprises a credit spread and a liquidity premium. That spread is intended to compensate investors for credit risk—risk of default and loss severity in the event of default—and the credit-related risks that can cause spreads to widen and prices to decline—downgrade or credit migration risk and market liquidity risk. Yield spread = Liquidity premium + Credit spread., In times of financial market stress, the liquidity premium can increase sharply, causing spreads to widen on all credit-risky bonds, with lower-quality issuers most affected. In times of credit improvement or stability, however, credit spreads can narrow sharply as well, providing attractive investment returns., Credit curves—the plot of yield spreads for a given bond issuer across the yield curve—are typically upward sloping, with the exception of high premium-priced bonds and distressed bonds, where credit curves can be inverted because of the fear of default, when all creditors at a given ranking in the capital structure will receive the same recovery rate without regard to debt maturity., The impact of spread changes on holding period returns for credit-risky bonds are a product of two primary factors: the basis point spread change and the sensitivity of price to yield as reflected by (end-of-period) modified duration and convexity. Spread narrowing enhances holding period returns, whereas spread widening has a negative impact on holding period returns. Longer-duration bonds have greater price and return sensitivity to changes in spread than shorter-duration bonds., For high-yield bonds, with their greater risk of default, more emphasis should be placed on an issuer’s sources of liquidity, as well as on its debt structure and corporate structure. Credit risk can vary greatly across an issuer’s debt structure depending on the seniority ranking. Many high-yield companies have complex capital structures, resulting in different levels of credit risk depending on where the debt resides., Covenant analysis is especially important for high-yield bonds. Key covenants include payment restrictions, limitation on liens, change of control, coverage maintenance tests (often limited to bank loans), and any guarantees from restricted subsidiaries. Covenant language can be very technical and legalistic, so it may help to seek legal or expert assistance., An equity-like approach to high-yield analysis can be helpful. Calculating and comparing enterprise value with EBITDA and debt/EBITDA can show a level of equity “cushion” or support beneath an issuer’s debt., Sovereign credit analysis includes assessing both an issuer’s ability and willingness to pay its debt obligations. Willingness to pay is important because, due to sovereign immunity, a sovereign government cannot be forced to pay its debts., In assessing sovereign credit risk, a helpful framework is to focus on five broad areas: (1) institutional effectiveness and political risks, (2) economic structure and growth prospects, (3) external liquidity and international investment position, (4) fiscal performance, flexibility, and debt burden, and (5) monetary flexibility., Among the characteristics of a high-quality sovereign credit are the absence of corruption and/or challenges to political framework; governmental checks and balances; respect for rule of law and property rights; commitment to honor debts; high per capita income with stable, broad-based growth prospects; control of a reserve or actively traded currency; currency flexibility; low foreign debt and foreign financing needs relative to receipts in foreign currencies; stable or declining ratio of debt to GDP; low debt service as a percent of revenue; low ratio of net debt to GDP; operationally independent central bank; track record of low and stable inflation; and a well-developed banking system and active money market., Non-sovereign or local government bonds, including municipal bonds, are typically either general obligation bonds or revenue bonds., General obligation (GO) bonds are backed by the taxing authority of the issuing non-sovereign government. The credit analysis of GO bonds has some similarities to sovereign analysis—debt burden per capita versus income per capita, tax burden, demographics, and economic diversity. Underfunded and “off-balance-sheet” liabilities, such as pensions for public employees and retirees, are debt-like in nature., Revenue-backed bonds support specific projects, such as toll roads, bridges, airports, and other infrastructure. The creditworthiness comes from the revenues generated by usage fees and tolls levied.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2023/RR-2023-L1V5R2-fundamentals-credit-analysis.pdf,

These choices and estimates require judgment, which can vary from one preparer to the next. Accordingly, standards are needed to ensure increased consistency in these judgments., Private sector standard setting bodies and regulatory authorities play significant but different roles in the standard setting process. In general, standard setting bodies make the rules, and regulatory authorities enforce the rules. However, regulators typically retain legal authority to establish financial reporting standards in their jurisdiction., The IFRS framework sets forth the concepts that underlie the preparation and presentation of financial statements for external users., The objective of fair presentation of useful information is the center of the IASB’s Conceptual Framework. The qualitative characteristics of useful information include fundamental and enhancing characteristics. Information must exhibit the fundamental characteristics of relevance and faithful representation to be useful. The enhancing characteristics identified are comparability, verifiability, timeliness, and understandability., IFRS Financial Statements: IAS No. 1 prescribes that a complete set of financial statements includes a statement of financial position (balance sheet), a statement of comprehensive income (either two statements—one for net income and one for comprehensive income—or a single statement combining both net income and comprehensive income), a statement of changes in equity, a cash flow statement, and notes. The notes include a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information., Financial statements need to reflect certain basic features: fair presentation, going concern, accrual basis, materiality and aggregation, and no offsetting., Financial statements must be prepared at least annually, must include comparative information from the previous period, and must be consistent., Financial statements must follow certain presentation requirements including a classified statement of financial position (balance sheet) and minimum information on both the face of the financial statements and in the notes., A significant number of the world’s listed companies report under either IFRS or US GAAP., In many cases, a user of financial statements will lack the information necessary to make specific adjustments required to achieve comparability between companies that use IFRS and companies that use US GAAP. Instead, an analyst must maintain general caution in interpreting comparative financial measures produced under different accounting standards and monitor significant developments in financial reporting standards., Analysts can remain aware of ongoing developments in financial reporting by monitoring new products or types of transactions; actions of standard setters, regulators, and other groups; and company disclosures regarding critical accounting policies and estimates.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2023/RR-2023-L1V2R10-financial-reporting-standards.pdf,

The cash flows of the debt obligations are used to make interest payments and principal repayments to the holders of the ABS., Securitization has several benefits. It allows investors direct access to liquid investments and payment streams that would be unattainable if all the financing were performed through banks. It enables banks to increase loan originations at economic scales greater than if they used only their own in-house loan portfolios. Thus, securitization contributes to lower costs of borrowing for entities raising funds, higher risk-adjusted returns to investors, and greater efficiency and profitability for the banking sector., The parties to a securitization include the seller of the collateral (pool of loans), the servicer of the loans, and the special purpose entity (SPE). The SPE is bankruptcy remote, which plays a pivotal role in the securitization., A common structure in a securitization is subordination, which leads to the creation of more than one bond class or tranche. Bond classes differ as to how they will share any losses resulting from defaults of the borrowers whose loans are in the collateral. The credit ratings assigned to the various bond classes depend on how the credit-rating agencies evaluate the credit risks of the collateral and any credit enhancements., The motivation for the creation of different types of structures is to redistribute prepayment risk and credit risk efficiently among different bond classes in the securitization. Prepayment risk is the uncertainty that the actual cash flows will be different from the scheduled cash flows as set forth in the loan agreements because borrowers may choose to repay the principal early to take advantage of interest rate movements., Because of the SPE, the securitization of a company’s assets may include some bond classes that have better credit ratings than the company itself or its corporate bonds. Thus, the company’s funding cost is often lower when raising funds through securitization than when issuing corporate bonds., A mortgage is a loan secured by the collateral of some specified real estate property that obliges the borrower to make a predetermined series of payments to the lender. The cash flow of a mortgage includes (1) interest, (2) scheduled principal payments, and (3) prepayments (any principal repaid in excess of the scheduled principal payment)., The various mortgage designs throughout the world specify (1) the maturity of the loan; (2) how the interest rate is determined (i.e., fixed rate versus adjustable or variable rate); (3) how the principal is repaid (i.e., whether the loan is amortizing and if it is, whether it is fully amortizing or partially amortizing with a balloon payment); (4) whether the borrower has the option to prepay and if so, whether any prepayment penalties might be imposed; and (5) the rights of the lender in a foreclosure (i.e., whether the loan is a recourse or non-recourse loan)., In the United States, there are three sectors for securities backed by residential mortgages: (1) those guaranteed by a federal agency (Ginnie Mae) whose securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the US government, (2) those guaranteed by a GSE (e.g., Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) but not by the US government, and (3) those issued by private entities that are not guaranteed by a federal agency or a GSE. The first two sectors are referred to as agency residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS), and the third sector, as non-agency RMBS., A mortgage pass-through security is created when one or more holders of mortgages form a pool of mortgages and sell shares or participation certificates in the pool. The cash flow of a mortgage pass-through security depends on the cash flow of the underlying pool of mortgages and consists of monthly mortgage payments representing interest, the scheduled repayment of principal, and any prepayments, net of servicing and other administrative fees., Market participants measure the prepayment rate using two measures: the single monthly mortality rate (SMM) and its corresponding annualized rate—namely, the conditional prepayment rate (CPR). For MBS, a measure widely used by market participants to assess effective duration is the weighted average life or simply the average life of the MBS., Market participants use the Public Securities Association (PSA) prepayment benchmark to describe prepayment rates. A PSA assumption greater than 100 PSA means that prepayments are assumed to occur faster than the benchmark, whereas a PSA assumption lower than 100 PSA means that prepayments are assumed to occur slower than the benchmark., Prepayment risk includes two components: contraction risk and extension risk. The former is the risk that when interest rates decline, the security will have a shorter maturity than was anticipated at the time of purchase because homeowners will refinance at the new, lower interest rates. The latter is the risk that when interest rates rise, fewer prepayments will occur than what was anticipated at the time of purchase because homeowners are reluctant to give up the benefits of a contractual interest rate that now looks low., The creation of a collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO) can help manage prepayment risk by distributing the various forms of prepayment risk among different classes of bondholders. The CMO’s major financial innovation is that the securities created more closely satisfy the asset/liability needs of institutional investors, thereby broadening the appeal of mortgage-backed products., The most common types of CMO tranche are sequential-pay tranches, planned amortization class (PAC) tranches, support tranches, and floating-rate tranches., Non-agency RMBS share many features and structuring techniques with agency CMOs. However, they typically include two complementary mechanisms. First, the cash flows are distributed by rules that dictate the allocation of interest payments and principal repayments to tranches with various degrees of priority/seniority. Second, there are rules for the allocation of realized losses that specify that subordinated bond classes have lower payment priority than senior classes., In order to obtain favorable credit ratings, non-agency RMBS and non-mortgage ABS often require one or more credit enhancements. The most common forms of internal credit enhancement are senior/subordinated structures, reserve funds, and overcollateralization. In external credit enhancement, credit support in the case of defaults resulting in losses in the pool of loans is provided in the form of a financial guarantee by a third party to the transaction., Commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) are securities backed by a pool of commercial mortgages on income-producing property., Two key indicators of the potential credit performance of CMBS are the debt-service-coverage (DSC) ratio and the loan-to-value ratio (LTV). The DSC ratio is the property’s annual net operating income divided by the debt service., CMBS have considerable call protection, which allows CMBS to trade in the market more like corporate bonds than like RMBS. This call protection comes in two forms: at the structure level and at the loan level. The creation of sequential-pay tranches is an example of call protection at the structure level. At the loan level, four mechanisms offer investors call protection: prepayment lockouts, prepayment penalty points, yield maintenance charges, and defeasance., ABS are backed by a wide range of asset types. The most popular non-mortgage ABS are auto loan ABS and credit card receivable ABS. The collateral is amortizing for auto loan ABS and non-amortizing for credit card receivable ABS. As with non-agency RMBS, these ABS must offer credit enhancement to be appealing to investors., A collateralized debt obligation (CDO) is a generic term used to describe a security backed by a diversified pool of one or more debt obligations (e.g., corporate and emerging market bonds, leveraged bank loans, ABS, RMBS, and CMBS)., A CDO involves the creation of an SPE. The funds necessary to pay the bond classes come from a pool of loans that must be serviced. A CDO requires a collateral manager to buy and sell debt obligations for and from the CDO’s portfolio of assets to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the obligations of the CDO bondholders and to generate a fair return for the equityholders., The structure of a CDO includes senior, mezzanine, and subordinated/equity bond classes., Covered bonds are similar to ABS, but they differ because of their dual recourse nature, strict eligibility criteria, dynamic cover pool, and redemption regimes in the event of sponsor default.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2023/RR-2023-L1V4R13-introduction-asset-backed-securities.pdf,

Numerical data (also called quantitative data) are values that represent measured or counted quantities as a number. Categorical data (also called qualitative data) are values that describe a quality or characteristic of a group of observations and usually take only a limited number of values that are mutually exclusive., Numerical data can be further split into two types: continuous data and discrete data. Continuous data can be measured and can take on any numerical value in a specified range of values. Discrete data are numerical values that result from a counting process and therefore are limited to a finite number of values., Categorical data can be further classified into two types: nominal data and ordinal data. Nominal data are categorical values that are not amenable to being organized in a logical order, while ordinal data are categorical values that can be logically ordered or ranked., Based on how they are collected, data can be categorized into three types: cross-sectional, time series, and panel. Time-series data are a sequence of observations for a single observational unit on a specific variable collected over time and at discrete and typically equally spaced intervals of time. Cross-sectional data are a list of the observations of a specific variable from multiple observational units at a given point in time. Panel data are a mix of time-series and cross-sectional data that consists of observations through time on one or more variables for multiple observational units., Based on whether or not data are in a highly organized form, they can be classified into structured and unstructured types. Structured data are highly organized in a pre-defined manner, usually with repeating patterns. Unstructured data do not follow any conventionally organized forms; they are typically alternative data as they are usually collected from unconventional sources., Raw data are typically organized into either a one-dimensional array or a two-dimensional rectangular array (also called a data table) for quantitative analysis., A frequency distribution is a tabular display of data constructed either by counting the observations of a variable by distinct values or groups or by tallying the values of a numerical variable into a set of numerically ordered bins. Frequency distributions permit us to evaluate how data are distributed., The relative frequency of observations in a bin (interval or bucket) is the number of observations in the bin divided by the total number of observations. The cumulative relative frequency cumulates (adds up) the relative frequencies as we move from the first bin to the last, thus giving the fraction of the observations that are less than the upper limit of each bin., A contingency table is a tabular format that displays the frequency distributions of two or more categorical variables simultaneously. One application of contingency tables is for evaluating the performance of a classification model (using a confusion matrix). Another application of contingency tables is to investigate a potential association between two categorical variables by performing a chi-square test of independence., Visualization is the presentation of data in a pictorial or graphical format for the purpose of increasing understanding and for gaining insights into the data., A histogram is a bar chart of data that have been grouped into a frequency distribution. A frequency polygon is a graph of frequency distributions obtained by drawing straight lines joining successive midpoints of bars representing the class frequencies., A bar chart is used to plot the frequency distribution of categorical data, with each bar representing a distinct category and the bar’s height (or length) proportional to the frequency of the corresponding category. Grouped bar charts or stacked bar charts can present the frequency distribution of multiple categorical variables simultaneously., A tree-map is a graphical tool to display categorical data. It consists of a set of colored rectangles to represent distinct groups, and the area of each rectangle is proportional to the value of the corresponding group. Additional dimensions of categorical data can be displayed by nested rectangles., A word cloud is a visual device for representing textual data, with the size of each distinct word being proportional to the frequency with which it appears in the given text., A line chart is a type of graph used to visualize ordered observations and often to display the change of data series over time. A bubble line chart is a special type of line chart that uses varying-sized bubbles as data points to represent an additional dimension of data., A scatter plot is a type of graph for visualizing the joint variation in two numerical variables. It is constructed by drawing dots to indicate the values of the two variables plotted against the corresponding axes. A scatter plot matrix organizes scatter plots between pairs of variables into a matrix format to inspect all pairwise relationships between more than two variables in one combined visual., A heat map is a type of graphic that organizes and summarizes data in a tabular format and represents it using a color spectrum. It is often used in displaying frequency distributions or visualizing the degree of correlation among different variables., The key consideration when selecting among chart types is the intended purpose of visualizing data (i.e., whether it is for exploring/presenting distributions or relationships or for making comparisons)., A population is defined as all members of a specified group. A sample is a subset of a population., A parameter is any descriptive measure of a population. A sample statistic (statistic, for short) is a quantity computed from or used to describe a sample., Sample statistics—such as measures of central tendency, measures of dispersion, skewness, and kurtosis—help with investment analysis, particularly in making probabilistic statements about returns., Measures of central tendency specify where data are centered and include the mean, median, and mode (i.e., the most frequently occurring value)., The arithmetic mean is the sum of the observations divided by the number of observations. It is the most frequently used measure of central tendency., The median is the value of the middle item (or the mean of the values of the two middle items) when the items in a set are sorted into ascending or descending order. The median is not influenced by extreme values and is most useful in the case of skewed distributions., The mode is the most frequently observed value and is the only measure of central tendency that can be used with nominal data. A distribution may be unimodal (one mode), bimodal (two modes), trimodal (three modes), or have even more modes., A portfolio’s return is a weighted mean return computed from the returns on the individual assets, where the weight applied to each asset’s return is the fraction of the portfolio invested in that asset., The geometric mean, X ¯ G , of a set of observations X 1, X 2, …, Xn , is X ¯ G = X 1 X 2 X 3 … X n n , with Xi ≥ 0 for i = 1, 2, …, n. The geometric mean is especially important in reporting compound growth rates for time-series data. The geometric mean will always be less than an arithmetic mean whenever there is variance in the observations., The harmonic mean, X ¯ H , is a type of weighted mean in which an observation’s weight is inversely proportional to its magnitude., Quantiles—such as the median, quartiles, quintiles, deciles, and percentiles—are location parameters that divide a distribution into halves, quarters, fifths, tenths, and hundredths, respectively., A box and whiskers plot illustrates the interquartile range (the “box”) as well as a range outside of the box that is based on the interquartile range, indicated by the “whiskers.”, Dispersion measures—such as the range, mean absolute deviation (MAD), variance, standard deviation, target downside deviation, and coefficient of variation—describe the variability of outcomes around the arithmetic mean., The range is the difference between the maximum value and the minimum value of the dataset. The range has only a limited usefulness because it uses information from only two observations., The MAD for a sample is the average of the absolute deviations of observations from the mean, ∑ i = 1 n | X i − X ¯ | n , where X ¯ is the sample mean and n is the number of observations in the sample., The variance is the average of the squared deviations around the mean, and the standard deviation is the positive square root of variance. In computing sample variance (s 2) and sample standard deviation (s), the average squared deviation is computed using a divisor equal to the sample size minus 1., The target downside deviation, or target semideviation, is a measure of the risk of being below a given target. It is calculated as the square root of the average squared deviations from the target, but it includes only those observations below the target (B), or ∑ for all X i ≤ B n ( X i − B ) 2 n − 1 ., The coefficient of variation, CV, is the ratio of the standard deviation of a set of observations to their mean value. By expressing the magnitude of variation among observations relative to their average size, the CV permits direct comparisons of dispersion across different datasets. Reflecting the correction for scale, the CV is a scale-free measure (i.e., it has no units of measurement)., Skew or skewness describes the degree to which a distribution is asymmetric about its mean. A return distribution with positive skewness has frequent small losses and a few extreme gains compared to a normal distribution. A return distribution with negative skewness has frequent small gains and a few extreme losses compared to a normal distribution. Zero skewness indicates a symmetric distribution of returns., Kurtosis measures the combined weight of the tails of a distribution relative to the rest of the distribution. A distribution with fatter tails than the normal distribution is referred to as fat-tailed (leptokurtic); a distribution with thinner tails than the normal distribution is referred to as thin-tailed (platykurtic). Excess kurtosis is kurtosis minus 3, since 3 is the value of kurtosis for all normal distributions., The correlation coefficient is a statistic that measures the association between two variables. It is the ratio of covariance to the product of the two variables’ standard deviations. A positive correlation coefficient indicates that the two variables tend to move together, whereas a negative coefficient indicates that the two variables tend to move in opposite directions. Correlation does not imply causation, simply association. Issues that arise in evaluating correlation include the presence of outliers and spurious correlation.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2023/RR-2023-L1V1R2-organizing-visualizing-describing-data.pdf,
Market Efficiency,2024 Curriculum,CFA Program Level I,Equity Investments,"The member should be able to: The candidate should be able to: describe market efficiency and related concepts, including their importance to investment practitioners; distinguish between market value and intrinsic value; explain factors that affect a market’s efficiency; contrast weak-form, semi-strong-form, and strong-form market efficiency; explain the implications of each form of market efficiency for fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and the choice between active and passive portfolio management; describe market anomalies; describe behavioral finance and its potential relevance to understanding market anomalies.","Market Efficiency and Active Manager Selection The chief investment officer (CIO) of a major university endowment fund has listed eight steps in the active manager selection process that can be applied both to traditional investments (e.g., common equity and fixed-income securities) and to alternative investments (e.g., private equity, hedge funds, and real assets). The first step specified is the evaluation of market opportunity: What is the opportunity and why is it there? To answer this question, we start by studying capital markets and the types of managers operating within those markets. We identify market inefficiencies and try to understand their causes, such as regulatory structures or behavioral biases. We can rule out many broad groups of managers and strategies by simply determining that the degree of market inefficiency necessary to support a strategy is implausible. Importantly, we consider the past history of active returns meaningless unless we understand why markets will allow those active returns to continue into the future. The CIO’s description underscores the importance of not assuming that past active returns that might be found in a historical dataset will repeat themselves in the future. refer to returns earned by strategies that do not assume that all information is fully reflected in market prices.","The efficiency of a market is affected by the number of market participants and depth of analyst coverage, information availability, and limits to trading., There are three forms of efficient markets, each based on what is considered to be the information used in determining asset prices. In the weak form, asset prices fully reflect all market data, which refers to all past price and trading volume information. In the semi-strong form, asset prices reflect all publicly known and available information. In the strong form, asset prices fully reflect all information, which includes both public and private information., Intrinsic value refers to the true value of an asset, whereas market value refers to the price at which an asset can be bought or sold. When markets are efficient, the two should be the same or very close. But when markets are not efficient, the two can diverge significantly., Most empirical evidence supports the idea that securities markets in developed countries are semi-strong-form efficient; however, empirical evidence does not support the strong form of the efficient market hypothesis., A number of anomalies have been documented that contradict the notion of market efficiency, including the size anomaly, the January anomaly, and the winners–losers anomalies. In most cases, however, contradictory evidence both supports and refutes the anomaly., Behavioral finance uses human psychology, such as behavioral biases, in an attempt to explain investment decisions. Whereas behavioral finance is helpful in understanding observed decisions, a market can still be considered efficient even if market participants exhibit seemingly irrational behaviors, such as herding.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level1a/RR_2024_L1V3R7_market_efficiency.pdf,

Otherwise, expenditures related to long-lived assets are expensed as incurred., Although capitalising expenditures, rather than expensing them, results in higher reported profitability in the initial year, it results in lower profitability in subsequent years; however, if a company continues to purchase similar or increasing amounts of assets each year, the profitability-enhancing effect of capitalisation continues., Capitalising an expenditure rather than expensing it results in a greater amount reported as cash from operations because capitalised expenditures are classified as an investing cash outflow rather than an operating cash outflow., Companies must capitalise interest costs associated with acquiring or constructing an asset that requires a long period of time to prepare for its intended use., Including capitalised interest in the calculation of interest coverage ratios provides a better assessment of a company’s solvency., IFRS require research costs be expensed but allow all development costs (not only software development costs) to be capitalised under certain conditions. Generally, US accounting standards require that research and development costs be expensed; however, certain costs related to software development are required to be capitalised., When one company acquires another company, the transaction is accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting in which the company identified as the acquirer allocates the purchase price to each asset acquired (and each liability assumed) on the basis of its fair value. Under acquisition accounting, if the purchase price of an acquisition exceeds the sum of the amounts that can be allocated to individual identifiable assets and liabilities, the excess is recorded as goodwill., The capitalised costs of long-lived tangible assets and of intangible assets with finite useful lives are allocated to expense in subsequent periods over their useful lives. For tangible assets, this process is referred to as depreciation, and for intangible assets, it is referred to as amortisation., Long-lived tangible assets and intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed for impairment whenever changes in events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable., Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are not amortised but are reviewed for impairment annually., Impairment disclosures can provide useful information about a company’s expected cash flows., Methods of calculating depreciation or amortisation expense include the straight-line method, in which the cost of an asset is allocated to expense in equal amounts each year over its useful life; accelerated methods, in which the allocation of cost is greater in earlier years; and the units-of-production method, in which the allocation of cost corresponds to the actual use of an asset in a particular period., Estimates required for depreciation and amortisation calculations include the useful life of the equipment (or its total lifetime productive capacity) and its expected residual value at the end of that useful life. A longer useful life and higher expected residual value result in a smaller amount of annual depreciation relative to a shorter useful life and lower expected residual value., IFRS permit the use of either the cost model or the revaluation model for the valuation and reporting of long-lived assets, but the revaluation model is not allowed under US GAAP., Under the revaluation model, carrying amounts are the fair values at the date of revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation or amortisation., In contrast with depreciation and amortisation charges, which serve to allocate the cost of a long-lived asset over its useful life, impairment charges reflect an unexpected decline in the fair value of an asset to an amount lower than its carrying amount., IFRS permit impairment losses to be reversed, with the reversal reported in profit. US GAAP do not permit the reversal of impairment losses., The gain or loss on the sale of long-lived assets is computed as the sales proceeds minus the carrying amount of the asset at the time of sale., Estimates of average age and remaining useful life of a company’s assets reflect the relationship between assets accounted for on a historical cost basis and depreciation amounts., The average remaining useful life of a company’s assets can be estimated as net PPE divided by depreciation expense, although the accounting useful life may not necessarily correspond to the economic useful life., Long-lived assets reclassified as held for sale cease to be depreciated or amortised. Long-lived assets to be disposed of other than by a sale (e.g., by abandonment, exchange for another asset, or distribution to owners in a spin-off) are classified as held for use until disposal. Thus, they continue to be depreciated and tested for impairment., Investment property is defined as property that is owned (or, in some cases, leased under a finance lease) for the purpose of earning rentals, capital appreciation, or both., Under IFRS, companies are allowed to value investment properties using either a cost model or a fair value model. The cost model is identical to the cost model used for property, plant, and equipment, but the fair value model differs from the revaluation model used for property, plant, and equipment. Unlike the revaluation model, under the fair value model, all changes in the fair value of investment property affect net income., Under US GAAP, investment properties are generally measured using the cost model.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2023/RR-2023-L1V3R6-long-lived-assets.pdf,

They expect a normal rate of return for bearing risk through time. Borrowers move money from the future to the present to fund current projects and expenditures. Hedgers trade to reduce their exposure to risks they prefer not to take. Information-motivated traders are active investment managers who try to identify under- and overvalued instruments., Securities are first sold in primary markets by their issuers. They then trade in secondary markets., People invest in pooled investment vehicles to benefit from the investment management services of their managers., Forward contracts allow buyers and sellers to arrange for future sales at predetermined prices. Futures contracts are forward contracts guaranteed by clearinghouses. The guarantee ensures that strangers are willing to trade with each other and that traders can offset their positions by trading with anybody. These features of futures contract markets make them highly attractive to hedgers and information-motivated traders., Many financial intermediaries connect buyers to sellers in a given instrument, acting directly as brokers and exchanges or indirectly as dealers and arbitrageurs., Financial intermediaries create instruments when they conduct arbitrage, securitize assets, borrow to lend, manage investment funds, or pool insurance contracts. These activities all transform cash flows and risks from one form to another. Their services allow buyers and sellers to connect with each other through instruments that meet their specific needs., Financial markets work best when strangers can contract with each other without worrying about whether their counterparts are able and willing to honor their contract. Clearinghouses, variation margins, maintenance margins, and settlement guarantees made by creditworthy brokers on behalf of their clients help manage credit risk and ultimately allow strangers to contract with each other., Information-motivated traders short sell when they expect that prices will fall. Hedgers short sell to reduce the risks of a long position in a related contract or commodity., Margin loans allow people to buy more securities than their equity would otherwise permit them to buy. The larger positions expose them to more risk so that gains and losses for a given amount of equity will be larger. The leverage ratio is the value of a position divided by the value of the equity supporting it. The returns to the equity in a position are equal to the leverage ratio times the returns to the unleveraged position., To protect against credit losses, brokers demand maintenance margin payments from their customers who have borrowed cash or securities when adverse price changes cause their customer’s equity to drop below the maintenance margin ratio. Brokers close positions for customers who do not satisfy these margin calls., Orders are instructions to trade. They always specify instrument, side (buy or sell), and quantity. They usually also provide several other instructions., Market orders tend to fill quickly but often at inferior prices. Limit orders generally fill at better prices if they fill, but they may not fill. Traders choose order submission strategies on the basis of how quickly they want to trade, the prices they are willing to accept, and the consequences of failing to trade., Stop instructions are attached to other orders to delay efforts to fill them until the stop condition is satisfied. Although stop orders are often used to stop losses, they are not always effective., Issuers sell their securities using underwritten public offerings, best efforts public offerings, private placements, shelf registrations, dividend reinvestment programs, and rights offerings. Investment banks have a conflict of interests when setting the initial offering price in an IPO., Well-functioning secondary markets are essential to raising capital in the primary markets because investors value the ability to sell their securities if they no longer want to hold them or if they need to disinvest to raise cash. If they cannot trade their securities in a liquid market, they will not pay as much for them., Matching buyers and sellers in call markets is easy because the traders (or their orders) come together at the same time and place., Dealers provide liquidity in quote-driven markets. Public traders as well as dealers provide liquidity in order-driven markets., Order-driven markets arrange trades by ranking orders using precedence rules. The rules generally ensure that traders who provide the best prices, display the most size, and arrive early trade first. Continuous order-driven markets price orders using the discriminatory pricing rule. Under this rule, standing limit orders determine trade prices., Brokers help people trade unique instruments or positions for which finding a buyer or a seller is difficult., Transaction costs are lower in transparent markets than in opaque markets because traders can more easily determine market value and more easily manage their trading in transparent markets., A well-functioning financial system allows people to trade instruments that best solve their wealth and risk management problems with low transaction costs. Complete and liquid markets characterize a well-functioning financial system. Complete markets are markets in which the instruments needed to solve investment and risk management problems are available to trade. Liquid markets are markets in which traders can trade when they want to trade at low cost., The financial system is operationally efficient when its markets are liquid. Liquid markets lower the costs of raising capital., A well-functioning financial system promotes wealth by ensuring that capital allocation decisions are well made. A well-functioning financial system also promotes wealth by allowing people to share the risks associated with valuable products that would otherwise not be undertaken., Prices are informationally efficient when they reflect all available information about fundamental values. Information-motivated traders make prices informationally efficient. Prices will be most informative in liquid markets because information-motivated traders will not invest in information and research if establishing positions based on their analyses is too costly., Regulators generally seek to promote fair and orderly markets in which traders can trade at prices that accurately reflect fundamental values without incurring excessive transaction costs. Governmental agencies and self-regulating organizations of practitioners provide regulatory services that attempt to make markets safer and more efficient., Mandated financial disclosure programs for the issuers of publicly traded securities ensure that information necessary to estimate security values is available to financial analysts on a consistent basis.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level1a/RR_2024_L1V3R5_market_organization_structure.pdf,

The discrepancy is a result of different treatments of certain income and expenditure items., The tax base of an asset is the amount that will be deductible for tax purposes as an expense in the calculation of taxable income as the company expenses the tax basis of the asset. If the economic benefit will not be taxable, the tax base of the asset will be equal to the carrying amount of the asset., The tax base of a liability is the carrying amount of the liability less any amounts that will be deductible for tax purposes in the future. With respect to revenue received in advance, the tax base of such a liability is the carrying amount less any amount of the revenue that will not be taxable in the future., Temporary differences arise from recognition of differences in the tax base and carrying amount of assets and liabilities. The creation of a deferred tax asset or liability as a result of a temporary difference will only be allowed if the difference reverses itself at some future date and to the extent that it is expected that the balance sheet item will create future economic benefits for the company., Permanent differences result in a difference in tax and financial reporting of revenue (expenses) that will not be reversed at some future date. Because it will not be reversed at a future date, these differences do not constitute temporary differences and do not give rise to a deferred tax asset or liability., Current taxes payable or recoverable are based on the applicable tax rates on the balance sheet date of an entity; in contrast, deferred taxes should be measured at the tax rate that is expected to apply when the asset is realized or the liability settled., All unrecognized deferred tax assets and liabilities must be reassessed on the appropriate balance sheet date and measured against their probable future economic benefit., Deferred tax assets must be assessed for their prospective recoverability. If it is probable that they will not be recovered at all or partly, the carrying amount should be reduced. Under US GAAP, this is done through the use of a valuation allowance.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2023/RR-2023-L1V3R7-income-taxes.pdf,

Significant non-cash transaction activities (if present) are reported by using a supplemental disclosure note to the cash flow statement., Cash flow statements under IFRS and US GAAP are similar; however, IFRS provide companies with more choices in classifying some cash flow items as operating, investing, or financing activities., Companies can use either the direct or the indirect method for reporting their operating cash flow: The direct method discloses operating cash inflows by source (e.g., cash received from customers, cash received from investment income) and operating cash outflows by use (e.g., cash paid to suppliers, cash paid for interest) in the operating activities section of the cash flow statement. The indirect method reconciles net income to operating cash flow by adjusting net income for all non-cash items and the net changes in the operating working capital accounts., The direct method discloses operating cash inflows by source (e.g., cash received from customers, cash received from investment income) and operating cash outflows by use (e.g., cash paid to suppliers, cash paid for interest) in the operating activities section of the cash flow statement., The indirect method reconciles net income to operating cash flow by adjusting net income for all non-cash items and the net changes in the operating working capital accounts., The cash flow statement is linked to a company’s income statement and comparative balance sheets and to data on those statements., Although the indirect method is most commonly used by companies, an analyst can generally convert it to an approximation of the direct format by following a simple three-step process., An evaluation of a cash flow statement should involve an assessment of the sources and uses of cash and the main drivers of cash flow within each category of activities., The analyst can use common-size statement analysis for the cash flow statement. Two approaches to developing the common-size statements are the total cash inflows/total cash outflows method and the percentage of net revenues method., The cash flow statement can be used to determine free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) and free cash flow to equity (FCFE)., The cash flow statement may also be used in financial ratios that measure a company’s profitability, performance, and financial strength.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2023/RR-2023-L1V3R3-understanding-cash-flow-statements.pdf,

The information presented in the reports —including the financial statements and notes and management’s commentary or management’s discussion and analysis—allows the financial analyst to assess a company’s financial position and performance and trends in that performance., The primary financial statements are the statement of financial position (i.e., the balance sheet), the statement of comprehensive income (or two statements consisting of an income statement and a statement of comprehensive income), the statement of changes in equity, and the statement of cash flows., The balance sheet discloses what resources a company controls (assets) and what it owes (liabilities) at a specific point in time. Owners’ equity represents the net assets of the company; it is the owners’ residual interest in, or residual claim on, the company’s assets after deducting its liabilities. The relationship among the three parts of the balance sheet (assets, liabilities, and owners’ equity) may be shown in equation form as follows: Assets = Liabilities + Owners’ equity., The income statement presents information on the financial results of a company’s business activities over a period of time. The income statement communicates how much revenue and other income the company generated during a period and what expenses, including losses, it incurred in connection with generating that revenue and other income. The basic equation underlying the income statement is Revenue + Other income – Expenses = Net income., The statement of comprehensive income includes all items that change owners’ equity except transactions with owners. Some of these items are included as part of net income, and some are reported as other comprehensive income (OCI)., The statement of changes in equity provides information about increases or decreases in the various components of owners’ equity., Although the income statement and balance sheet provide measures of a company’s success, cash and cash flow are also vital to a company’s long-term success. Disclosing the sources and uses of cash helps creditors, investors, and other statement users evaluate the company’s liquidity, solvency, and financial flexibility., The notes (also referred to as footnotes) that accompany the financial statements are an integral part of those statements and provide information that is essential to understanding the statements. Analysts should evaluate note disclosures regarding the use of alternative accounting methods, estimates, and assumptions., In addition to the financial statements, a company provides other sources of information that are useful to the financial analyst. As part of his or her analysis, the financial analyst should read and assess this additional information, particularly that presented in the management commentary (also called management report[ing], operating and financial review, and management’s discussion and analysis [MD&A])., A publicly traded company must have an independent audit performed on its annual financial statements. The auditor’s report expresses an opinion on the financial statements and provides some assurance about whether the financial statements fairly present a company’s financial position, performance, and cash flows. In addition, for US publicly traded companies, auditors must also express an opinion on the company’s internal control systems., Information on the economy, industry, and peer companies is useful in putting the company’s financial performance and position in perspective and in assessing the company’s future. In most cases, information from sources apart from the company are crucial to an analyst’s effectiveness., The financial statement analysis framework provides steps that can be followed in any financial statement analysis project. These steps are: articulate the purpose and context of the analysis; collect input data; process data; analyze/interpret the processed data; develop and communicate conclusions and recommendations; and follow up., articulate the purpose and context of the analysis;, collect input data;, process data;, analyze/interpret the processed data;, develop and communicate conclusions and recommendations; and, follow up.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level1a/RR_2024_L1V2R10_intro_financial_statement_analysis.pdf,

It has important effects, either directly or indirectly, on the pricing and flows in all other financial markets., There is a wide diversity of global FX market participants that have a wide variety of motives for entering into foreign exchange transactions., Individual currencies are usually referred to by standardized three-character codes. These currency codes can also be used to define exchange rates (the price of one currency in terms of another). There are a variety of exchange rate quoting conventions commonly used., A direct currency quote takes the domestic currency as the price currency and the foreign currency as the base currency (i.e., Sd/f). An indirect quote uses the domestic currency as the base currency (i.e., Sf/d). To convert between direct and indirect quotes, the inverse (reciprocal) is used. Professional FX markets use standardized conventions for how the exchange rate for specific currency pairs will be quoted., Currencies trade in foreign exchange markets based on nominal exchange rates. An increase (decrease) in the exchange rate, quoted in indirect terms, means that the domestic currency is appreciating (depreciating) versus the foreign currency., The real exchange rate, defined as the nominal exchange rate multiplied by the ratio of price levels, measures the relative purchasing power of the currencies. An increase in the real exchange rate (Rd/f) implies a reduction in the relative purchasing power of the domestic currency., Given exchange rates for two currency pairs—A/B and A/C—we can compute the cross-rate (B/C) between currencies B and C. Depending on how the rates are quoted, this may require inversion of one of the quoted rates., Spot exchange rates are for immediate settlement (typically, T + 2), while forward exchange rates are for settlement at agreed-upon future dates. Forward rates can be used to manage foreign exchange risk exposures or can be combined with spot transactions to create FX swaps., The spot exchange rate, the forward exchange rate, and the domestic and foreign interest rates must jointly satisfy an arbitrage relationship that equates the investment return on two alternative but equivalent investments. Given the spot exchange rate and the foreign and domestic interest rates, the forward exchange rate must take the value that prevents riskless arbitrage., Forward rates are typically quoted in terms of forward (or swap) points. The swap points are added to the spot exchange rate in order to calculate the forward rate. Occasionally, forward rates are presented in terms of percentages relative to the spot rate., The base currency is said to be trading at a forward premium if the forward rate is above the spot rate (forward points are positive). Conversely, the base currency is said to be trading at a forward discount if the forward rate is below the spot rate (forward points are negative)., The currency with the higher (lower) interest rate will trade at a forward discount (premium)., Swap points are proportional to the spot exchange rate and to the interest rate differential and approximately proportional to the term of the forward contract., Empirical studies suggest that forward exchange rates may be unbiased predictors of future spot rates, but the margin of error on such forecasts is too large for them to be used in practice as a guide to managing exchange rate exposures. FX markets are too complex and too intertwined with other global financial markets to be adequately characterized by a single variable, such as the interest rate differential., Virtually every exchange rate is managed to some degree by central banks. The policy framework that each central bank adopts is called an exchange rate regime. These regimes range from using another country’s currency (dollarization), to letting the market determine the exchange rate (independent float). In practice, most regimes fall in between these extremes. The type of exchange rate regime used varies widely among countries and over time., An ideal currency regime would have three properties: (1) the exchange rate between any two currencies would be credibly fixed; (2) all currencies would be fully convertible; and (3) each country would be able to undertake fully independent monetary policy in pursuit of domestic objectives, such as growth and inflation targets. However, these conditions are inconsistent. In particular, a fixed exchange rate and unfettered capital flows severely limit a country’s ability to undertake independent monetary policy. Hence, there cannot be an ideal currency regime., The IMF identifies the following types of regimes: arrangements with no separate legal tender (dollarization, monetary union), currency board, fixed parity, target zone, crawling peg, crawling band, managed float, and independent float. Most major currencies traded in FX markets are freely floating, albeit subject to occasional central bank intervention., A trade surplus (deficit) must be matched by a corresponding deficit (surplus) in the capital account. Any factor that affects the trade balance must have an equal and opposite impact on the capital account, and vice versa., A trade surplus reflects an excess of domestic saving (including the government fiscal balance) over investment spending. A trade deficit indicates that the country invests more than it saves and must finance the excess by borrowing from foreigners or selling assets to foreigners., The impact of the exchange rate on trade and capital flows can be analyzed from two perspectives. The elasticities approach focuses on the effect of changing the relative price of domestic and foreign goods. This approach highlights changes in the composition of spending. The absorption approach focuses on the impact of exchange rates on aggregate expenditure/saving decisions., The elasticities approach leads to the Marshall–Lerner condition, which describes combinations of export and import demand elasticities such that depreciation (appreciation) of the domestic currency will move the trade balance toward surplus (deficit)., The idea underlying the Marshall–Lerner condition is that demand for imports and exports must be sufficiently price-sensitive so that an increase in the relative price of imports increases the difference between export receipts and import expenditures., In order to move the trade balance toward surplus (deficit), a change in the exchange rate must decrease (increase) domestic expenditure (also called absorption) relative to income. Equivalently, it must increase (decrease) domestic saving relative to domestic investment., If there is excess capacity in the economy, then currency depreciation can increase output/income by switching demand toward domestically produced goods and services. Because some of the additional income will be saved, income rises relative to expenditure and the trade balance improves., If the economy is at full employment, then currency depreciation must reduce domestic expenditure in order to improve the trade balance. The main mechanism is a wealth effect: A weaker currency reduces the purchasing power of domestic-currency-denominated assets (including the present value of current and future earned income), and households respond by reducing expenditure and increasing saving.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2023/RR-2023-L1V2R8-currency-exchange-rates.pdf,

The carrying value includes the amortization of the discount or premium if the bond is purchased at a price below or above par value. The carrying value is any point on the constant-yield price trajectory., Interest income on a bond is the return associated with the passage of time. Capital gains and losses are the returns associated with a change in the value of a bond as indicated by a change in the yield-to-maturity., The two types of interest rate risk on a fixed-rate bond are coupon reinvestment risk and market price risk. These risks offset each other to a certain extent. An investor gains from higher rates on reinvested coupons but loses if the bond is sold at a capital loss because the price is below the constant-yield price trajectory. An investor loses from lower rates on reinvested coupon but gains if the bond is sold at a capital gain because the price is above the constant-yield price trajectory., Market price risk dominates coupon reinvestment risk when the investor has a short-term horizon (relative to the time-to-maturity on the bond)., Coupon reinvestment risk dominates market price risk when the investor has a long-term horizon (relative to the time-to-maturity)—for instance, a buy-and-hold investor., Bond duration, in general, measures the sensitivity of the full price (including accrued interest) to a change in interest rates., Yield duration statistics measuring the sensitivity of a bond’s full price to the bond’s own yield-to-maturity include the Macaulay duration, modified duration, money duration, and price value of a basis point., Curve duration statistics measuring the sensitivity of a bond’s full price to the benchmark yield curve are usually called “effective durations.”, Macaulay duration is the weighted average of the time to receipt of coupon interest and principal payments, in which the weights are the shares of the full price corresponding to each payment. This statistic is annualized by dividing by the periodicity (number of coupon payments or compounding periods in a year)., Modified duration provides a linear estimate of the percentage price change for a bond given a change in its yield-to-maturity., Approximate modified duration approaches modified duration as the change in the yield-to-maturity approaches zero., Effective duration is very similar to approximate modified duration. The difference is that approximate modified duration is a yield duration statistic that measures interest rate risk in terms of a change in the bond’s own yield-to-maturity, whereas effective duration is a curve duration statistic that measures interest rate risk assuming a parallel shift in the benchmark yield curve., Key rate duration is a measure of a bond’s sensitivity to a change in the benchmark yield curve at specific maturity segments. Key rate durations can be used to measure a bond’s sensitivity to changes in the shape of the yield curve., Bonds with an embedded option do not have a meaningful internal rate of return because future cash flows are contingent on interest rates. Therefore, effective duration is the appropriate interest rate risk measure, not modified duration., The effective duration of a traditional (option-free) fixed-rate bond is its sensitivity to the benchmark yield curve, which can differ from its sensitivity to its own yield-to-maturity. Therefore, modified duration and effective duration on a traditional (option-free) fixed-rate bond are not necessarily equal., During a coupon period, Macaulay and modified durations decline smoothly in a “saw-tooth” pattern, assuming the yield-to-maturity is constant. When the coupon payment is made, the durations jump upward., Macaulay and modified durations are inversely related to the coupon rate and the yield-to-maturity., Time-to-maturity and Macaulay and modified durations are usually positively related. They are always positively related on bonds priced at par or at a premium above par value. They are usually positively related on bonds priced at a discount below par value. The exception is on long-term, low-coupon bonds, on which it is possible to have a lower duration than on an otherwise comparable shorter-term bond., The presence of an embedded call option reduces a bond’s effective duration compared with that of an otherwise comparable non-callable bond. The reduction in the effective duration is greater when interest rates are low and the issuer is more likely to exercise the call option., The presence of an embedded put option reduces a bond’s effective duration compared with that of an otherwise comparable non-putable bond. The reduction in the effective duration is greater when interest rates are high and the investor is more likely to exercise the put option., The duration of a bond portfolio can be calculated in two ways: (1) the weighted average of the time to receipt of aggregate cash flows and (2) the weighted average of the durations of individual bonds that compose the portfolio., The first method to calculate portfolio duration is based on the cash flow yield, which is the internal rate of return on the aggregate cash flows. It cannot be used for bonds with embedded options or for floating-rate notes., The second method is simpler to use and quite accurate when the yield curve is relatively flat. Its main limitation is that it assumes a parallel shift in the yield curve in that the yields on all bonds in the portfolio change by the same amount., Money duration is a measure of the price change in terms of units of the currency in which the bond is denominated., The price value of a basis point (PVBP) is an estimate of the change in the full price of a bond given a 1 bp change in the yield-to-maturity., Modified duration is the primary, or first-order, effect on a bond’s percentage price change given a change in the yield-to-maturity. Convexity is the secondary, or second-order, effect. It indicates the change in the modified duration as the yield-to-maturity changes., Money convexity is convexity times the full price of the bond. Combined with money duration, money convexity estimates the change in the full price of a bond in units of currency given a change in the yield-to-maturity., Convexity is a positive attribute for a bond. Other things being equal, a more convex bond appreciates in price more than a less convex bond when yields fall and depreciates less when yields rise., Effective convexity is the second-order effect on a bond price given a change in the benchmark yield curve. It is similar to approximate convexity. The difference is that approximate convexity is based on a yield-to-maturity change and effective convexity is based on a benchmark yield curve change., Callable bonds have negative effective convexity when interest rates are low. The increase in price when the benchmark yield is reduced is less in absolute value than the decrease in price when the benchmark yield is raised., The change in a bond price is the product of: (1) the impact per basis-point change in the yield-to-maturity and (2) the number of basis points in the yield change. The first factor is estimated by duration and convexity. The second factor depends on yield volatility., The investment horizon is essential in measuring the interest rate risk on a fixed-rate bond., For a particular assumption about yield volatility, the Macaulay duration indicates the investment horizon for which coupon reinvestment risk and market price risk offset each other. The assumption is a one-time parallel shift to the yield curve in which the yield-to-maturity and coupon reinvestment rates change by the same amount in the same direction., When the investment horizon is greater than the Macaulay duration of the bond, coupon reinvestment risk dominates price risk. The investor’s risk is to lower interest rates. The duration gap is negative., When the investment horizon is equal to the Macaulay duration of the bond, coupon reinvestment risk offsets price risk. The duration gap is zero., When the investment horizon is less than the Macaulay duration of the bond, price risk dominates coupon reinvestment risk. The investor’s risk is to higher interest rates. The duration gap is positive., Credit risk involves the probability of default and degree of recovery if default occurs, whereas liquidity risk refers to the transaction costs associated with selling a bond., For a traditional (option-free) fixed-rate bond, the same duration and convexity statistics apply if a change occurs in the benchmark yield or a change occurs in the spread. The change in the spread can result from a change in credit risk or liquidity risk., In practice, there often is interaction between changes in benchmark yields and in the spread over the benchmark., Empirical duration uses statistical methods and historical bond prices to derive the price–yield relationship for specific bonds or bond portfolios.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2023/RR-2023-L1V5R1-understanding-fixed-income-risk-return.pdf,

If the estimated value equals the market price, the analyst infers the security is fairly valued. If the estimated value is less than the market price, the analyst infers the security is overvalued. Because of the uncertainties involved in valuation, an analyst may require that value estimates differ markedly from market price before concluding that a misvaluation exists., Analysts often use more than one valuation model because of concerns about the applicability of any particular model and the variability in estimates that result from changes in inputs., Three major categories of equity valuation models are present value, multiplier, and asset-based valuation models., Present value models estimate value as the present value of expected future benefits., Multiplier models estimate intrinsic value based on a multiple of some fundamental variable., Asset-based valuation models estimate value based on the estimated value of assets and liabilities., The choice of model will depend upon the availability of information to input into the model and the analyst’s confidence in both the information and the appropriateness of the model., Companies distribute cash to shareholders using dividend payments and share repurchases., Regular cash dividends are a key input to dividend valuation models., Key dates in dividend chronology are the declaration date, ex-dividend date, holder-of-record date, and payment date., In the dividend discount model, value is estimated as the present value of expected future dividends., In the free cash flow to equity model, value is estimated as the present value of expected future free cash flow to equity., The Gordon growth model, a simple DDM, estimates value as D 1/(r – g)., The two stage dividend discount model estimates value as the sum of the present values of dividends over a short-term period of high growth and the present value of the terminal value at the end of the period of high growth. The terminal value is estimated using the Gordon growth model., The choice of dividend model is based upon the patterns assumed with respect to future dividends., Multiplier models typically use multiples of the form: P/ measure of fundamental variable or EV/ measure of fundamental variable., Multiples can be based upon fundamentals or comparables., Asset-based valuations models estimate value of equity as the value of the assets less the value of liabilities.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level1a/RR_2024_L1V3R12_equity_valuation_concepts_basic_tools.pdf,

Business risk is the risk associated with operating earnings and reflects both sales risk (uncertainty with respect to the price and quantity of sales) and operating risk (the risk related to the use of fixed costs in operations). Financial risk is the risk associated with how a company finances its operations (i.e., the split between equity and debt financing of the business)., The degree of operating leverage (DOL) is the ratio of the percentage change in operating income to the percentage change in units sold. We can use the following formula to measure the degree of operating leverage: DOL=Q(P−V)Q(P−V)−F, The degree of financial leverage (DFL) is the percentage change in net income for a one percent change in operating income. We can use the following formula to measure the degree of financial leverage: DFL=[Q(P−V)−F](1−t)[Q(P−V)−F−C](1−t)=[Q(P−V)−F][Q(P−V)−F−C], The degree of total leverage (DTL) is a measure of the sensitivity of net income to changes in unit sales, which is equivalent to DTL = DOL × DFL., The breakeven point, QBE, is the number of units produced and sold at which the company’s net income is zero, which we calculate as QBE=F+CP−V, The operating breakeven point, QOBE, is the number of units produced and sold at which the company’s operating income is zero, which we calculate as",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2023/RR-2023-L1V4R3-measures-leverage.pdf,

Such companies generate their sales and profits through inventory transactions on a regular basis. An important consideration in determining profits for these companies is measuring the cost of sales when inventories are sold., The total cost of inventories comprises all costs of purchase, costs of conversion, and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Storage costs of finished inventory and abnormal costs due to waste are typically treated as expenses in the period in which they occurred., The allowable inventory valuation methods implicitly involve different assumptions about cost flows. The choice of inventory valuation method determines how the cost of goods available for sale during the period is allocated between inventory and cost of sales., IFRS allow three inventory valuation methods (cost formulas): first-in, first-out (FIFO); weighted average cost; and specific identification. The specific identification method is used for inventories of items that are not ordinarily interchangeable and for goods or services produced and segregated for specific projects. US GAAP allow the three methods above plus the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. The LIFO method is widely used in the United States for both tax and financial reporting purposes because of potential income tax savings., The choice of inventory method affects the financial statements and any financial ratios that are based on them. As a consequence, the analyst must carefully consider inventory valuation method differences when evaluating a company’s performance over time or in comparison to industry data or industry competitors., A company must use the same cost formula for all inventories having a similar nature and use to the entity., The inventory accounting system (perpetual or periodic) may result in different values for cost of sales and ending inventory when the weighted average cost or LIFO inventory valuation method is used., Under US GAAP, companies that use the LIFO method must disclose in their financial notes the amount of the LIFO reserve or the amount that would have been reported in inventory if the FIFO method had been used. This information can be used to adjust reported LIFO inventory and cost of goods sold balances to the FIFO method for comparison purposes., LIFO liquidation occurs when the number of units in ending inventory declines from the number of units that were present at the beginning of the year. If inventory unit costs have generally risen from year to year, this will produce an inventory-related increase in gross profits., Consistency of inventory costing is required under both IFRS and US GAAP. If a company changes an accounting policy, the change must be justifiable and applied retrospectively to the financial statements. An exception to the retrospective restatement is when a company reporting under US GAAP changes to the LIFO method., Under IFRS, inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Under US GAAP, inventories are measured at the lower of cost, market value, or net realisable value depending upon the inventory method used. Market value is defined as current replacement cost subject to an upper limit of net realizable value and a lower limit of net realizable value less a normal profit margin. Reversals of previous write-downs are permissible under IFRS but not under US GAAP., Reversals of inventory write-downs may occur under IFRS but are not allowed under US GAAP., Changes in the carrying amounts within inventory classifications (such as raw materials, work-in-process, and finished goods) may provide signals about a company’s future sales and profits. Relevant information with respect to inventory management and future sales may be found in the Management Discussion and Analysis or similar items within the annual or quarterly reports, industry news and publications, and industry economic data., The inventory turnover ratio, number of days of inventory ratio, and gross profit margin ratio are useful in evaluating the management of a company’s inventory., Inventory management may have a substantial impact on a company’s activity, profitability, liquidity, and solvency ratios. It is critical for the analyst to be aware of industry trends and management’s intentions., Financial statement disclosures provide information regarding the accounting policies adopted in measuring inventories, the principal uncertainties regarding the use of estimates related to inventories, and details of the inventory carrying amounts and costs. This information can greatly assist analysts in their evaluation of a company’s inventory management.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2023/RR-2023-L1V3R5-inventories.pdf,

Reconstitution can dramatically affect prices of current and prospective constituents., Indexes serve a variety of purposes. They gauge market sentiment and serve as benchmarks for actively managed portfolios. They act as proxies for measuring systematic risk and risk-adjusted performance. They also serve as proxies for asset classes in asset allocation models and as model portfolios for investment products., Investors can choose from security market indexes representing various asset classes, including equity, fixed-income, commodity, real estate, and hedge fund indexes., Within most asset classes, index providers offer a wide variety of indexes, ranging from broad market indexes to highly specialized indexes based on the issuer’s geographic region, economic development group, or economic sector or other factors., Proper use of security market indexes depends on understanding their construction and management.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level1a/RR_2024_L1V3R6_security_market_indexes.pdf,

Non-cumulative preference shares have no such provisions, implying that the dividend payments are at the company’s discretion and are thus similar to payments made to common shareholders., Participating preference shares allow investors to receive the standard preferred dividend plus the opportunity to receive a share of corporate profits above a pre-specified amount. Non-participating preference shares allow investors to simply receive the initial investment plus any accrued dividends in the event of liquidation., Callable and putable preference shares provide issuers and investors with the same rights and obligations as their common share counterparts., Private equity securities are issued primarily to institutional investors in private placements and do not trade in secondary equity markets. There are three types of private equity investments: venture capital, leveraged buyouts, and private investments in public equity (PIPE)., The objective of private equity investing is to increase the ability of the company’s management to focus on its operating activities for long-term value creation. The strategy is to take the “private” company “public” after certain profit and other benchmarks have been met., Depository receipts are securities that trade like ordinary shares on a local exchange but which represent an economic interest in a foreign company.

Company and industry analysis together can provide insight into sources of industry revenue growth and competitors’ market shares and thus the future of an individual company’s top-line growth and bottom-line profitability., Industry analysis is useful for: understanding a company’s business and business environment; identifying active equity investment opportunities; formulating an industry or sector rotation strategy; and portfolio performance attribution., understanding a company’s business and business environment;, identifying active equity investment opportunities;, formulating an industry or sector rotation strategy; and, portfolio performance attribution., The three main approaches to classifying companies are: products and/or services supplied; business-cycle sensitivities; and statistical similarities., products and/or services supplied;, business-cycle sensitivities; and, statistical similarities., Commercial industry classification systems include: Global Industry Classification Standard; Russell Global Sectors; and Industry Classification Benchmark., Global Industry Classification Standard;, Russell Global Sectors; and, Industry Classification Benchmark., Governmental industry classification systems include: International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities; Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community; Australian and New Zealand Standard Industrial Classification; and North American Industry Classification System., International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities;, Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community;, Australian and New Zealand Standard Industrial Classification; and, North American Industry Classification System., A limitation of current classification systems is that the narrowest classification unit assigned to a company generally cannot be assumed to constitute its peer group for the purposes of detailed fundamental comparisons or valuation., A peer group is a group of companies engaged in similar business activities whose economics and valuation are influenced by closely related factors., Steps in constructing a preliminary list of peer companies: Examine commercial classification systems if available. These systems often provide a useful starting point for identifying companies operating in the same industry. Review the subject company’s annual report for a discussion of the competitive environment. Companies frequently cite specific competitors. Review competitors’ annual reports to identify other potential comparables. Review industry trade publications to identify additional peer companies. Confirm that each comparable or peer company derives a significant portion of its revenue and operating profit from a similar business activity as the subject company., Examine commercial classification systems if available. These systems often provide a useful starting point for identifying companies operating in the same industry., Review the subject company’s annual report for a discussion of the competitive environment. Companies frequently cite specific competitors., Review competitors’ annual reports to identify other potential comparables., Review industry trade publications to identify additional peer companies., Confirm that each comparable or peer company derives a significant portion of its revenue and operating profit from a similar business activity as the subject company., Not all industries are created equal. Some are highly competitive, with many companies struggling to earn returns in excess of their cost of capital, and other industries have attractive characteristics that enable a majority of industry participants to generate healthy profits., Differing competitive environments are determined by the structural attributes of the industry. For this important reason, industry analysis is a vital complement to company analysis. The analyst needs to understand the context in which a company operates to fully understand the opportunities and threats that a company faces., The framework for strategic analysis known as “Porter’s five forces” can provide a useful starting point. Porter maintains that the profitability of companies in an industry is determined by five forces: 1) The threat of new entrants, which in turn is determined by economies of scale, brand loyalty, absolute cost advantages, customer switching costs, and government regulation; 2) the bargaining power of suppliers, which is a function of the feasibility of product substitution, the concentration of the buyer and supplier groups, and switching costs and entry costs in each case; 3) the bargaining power of buyers, which is a function of switching costs among customers and the ability of customers to produce their own product; 4) the threat of substitutes; and 5) the intensity of rivalry among existing competitors, which in turn is a function of industry competitive structure, demand conditions, cost conditions, and the height of exit barriers., The concept of barriers to entry refers to the ease with which new competitors can challenge incumbents and can be an important factor in determining the competitive environment of an industry. If new competitors can easily enter the industry, the industry is likely to be highly competitive because incumbents that attempt to raise prices will be undercut by newcomers. As a result, industries with low barriers to entry tend to have low pricing power. Conversely, if incumbents are protected by barriers to entry, they may enjoy a more benign competitive environment that gives them greater pricing power over their customers because they do not have to worry about being undercut by upstarts., Industry concentration is often, although not always, a sign that an industry may have pricing power and rational competition. Industry fragmentation is a much stronger signal, however, that the industry is competitive and pricing power is limited., The effect of industry capacity on pricing is clear: Tight capacity gives participants more pricing power because demand for products or services exceeds supply; overcapacity leads to price cutting and a highly competitive environment as excess supply chases demand. The analyst should think about not only current capacity conditions but also future changes in capacity levels—how long it takes for supply and demand to come into balance and what effect that process has on industry pricing power and returns., Examining the market share stability of an industry over time is similar to thinking about barriers to entry and the frequency with which new players enter an industry. Stable market shares typically indicate less competitive industries, whereas unstable market shares often indicate highly competitive industries with limited pricing power., An industry’s position in its life cycle often has a large impact on its competitive dynamics, so it is important to keep this positioning in mind when performing strategic analysis of an industry. Industries, like individual companies, tend to evolve over time and usually experience significant changes in the rate of growth and levels of profitability along the way. Just as an investment in an individual company requires careful monitoring, industry analysis is a continuous process that must be repeated over time to identify changes that may be occurring., A useful framework for analyzing the evolution of an industry is an industry life-cycle model, which identifies the sequential stages that an industry typically goes through. The five stages of an industry life cycle according to the Hill and Jones model are: embryonic; growth; shakeout; mature; and decline., embryonic;, growth;, shakeout;, mature; and, decline., Price competition and thinking like a customer are important factors that are often overlooked when analyzing an industry. Whatever factors most influence customer purchasing decisions are also likely to be the focus of competitive rivalry in the industry. Broadly, industries for which price is a large factor in customer purchase decisions tend to be more competitive than industries in which customers value other attributes more highly., External influences on industry growth, profitability, and risk include: technology; demographics; government; and social factors., technology;, demographics;, government; and, social factors., Company analysis takes place after the analyst has gained an understanding of the company’s external environment and includes answering questions about how the company will respond to the threats and opportunities presented by the external environment. This intended response is the individual company’s competitive strategy. The analyst should seek to determine whether the strategy is primarily defensive or offensive in its nature and how the company intends to implement it., Porter identifies two chief competitive strategies: A low-cost strategy (cost leadership) is one in which companies strive to become the low-cost producers and to gain market share by offering their products and services at lower prices than their competition while still making a profit margin sufficient to generate a superior rate of return based on the higher revenues achieved. A product/service differentiation strategy is one in which companies attempt to establish themselves as the suppliers or producers of products and services that are unique either in quality, type, or means of distribution. To be successful, the companies’ price premiums must be above their costs of differentiation and the differentiation must be appealing to customers and sustainable over time., A low-cost strategy (cost leadership) is one in which companies strive to become the low-cost producers and to gain market share by offering their products and services at lower prices than their competition while still making a profit margin sufficient to generate a superior rate of return based on the higher revenues achieved., A product/service differentiation strategy is one in which companies attempt to establish themselves as the suppliers or producers of products and services that are unique either in quality, type, or means of distribution.

Monetary policy refers to central bank activities that are directed toward influencing the quantity of money and credit in an economy. By contrast, fiscal policy refers to the government’s decisions about taxation and spending. The two sets of policies affect the economy via different mechanisms., Money fulfills three important functions: It acts as a medium of exchange, provides individuals with a way of storing wealth, and provides society with a convenient unit of account. Via the process of fractional reserve banking, the banking system can create money., The amount of wealth that the citizens of an economy choose to hold in the form of money—as opposed to, for example, bonds or equities—is known as the demand for money. There are three basic motives for holding money: transactions-related, precautionary, and speculative., The addition of 1 unit of additional reserves to a fractional reserve banking system can support an expansion of the money supply by an amount equal to the money multiplier, defined as 1/reserve requirement (stated as a decimal)., The nominal rate of interest is comprised of three components: a real required rate of return, a component to compensate lenders for future inflation, and a risk premium to compensate lenders for uncertainty (e.g., about the future rate of inflation)., Central banks take on multiple roles in modern economies. They are usually the monopoly supplier of their currency, the lender of last resort to the banking sector, the government’s bank and bank of the banks, and they often supervise banks. Although they may express their objectives in different ways, the overarching objective of most central banks is price stability., For a central bank to be able to implement monetary policy objectively, it should have a degree of independence from government, be credible, and be transparent in its goals and objectives., The ultimate challenge for central banks as they try to manipulate the supply of money to influence the economy is that they cannot control the amount of money that households and corporations put in banks on deposit, nor can they easily control the willingness of banks to create money by expanding credit. Taken together, this also means that they cannot always control the money supply. Therefore, there are definite limits to the power of monetary policy., The concept of money neutrality is usually interpreted as meaning that money cannot influence the real economy in the long run. However, by the setting of its policy rate, a central bank hopes to influence the real economy via the policy rate’s impact on other market interest rates, asset prices, the exchange rate, and the expectations of economic agents., Inflation targeting is the most common monetary policy—although exchange rate targeting is also used, particularly in developing economies. Quantitative easing attempts to spur aggregate demand by drastically increasing the money supply., Fiscal policy involves the use of government spending and revenue raising (taxation) to impact a number of aspects of the economy: the overall level of aggregate demand in an economy and hence the level of economic activity; the distribution of income and wealth among different segments of the population; and hence ultimately the allocation of resources between different sectors and economic agents., The tools that governments use in implementing fiscal policy are related to the way in which they raise revenue and the different forms of expenditure. Governments usually raise money via a combination of direct and indirect taxes. Government expenditure can be current on goods and services or can take the form of capital expenditure, for example, on infrastructure projects., As economic growth weakens, or when it is in recession, a government can enact an expansionary fiscal policy—for example, by raising expenditure without an offsetting increase in taxation. Conversely, by reducing expenditure and maintaining tax revenues, a contractionary policy might reduce economic activity. Fiscal policy can therefore play an important role in stabilizing an economy., Although both fiscal and monetary policy can alter aggregate demand, they work through different channels, the policies are therefore not interchangeable, and they conceivably can work against one another unless the government and central bank coordinate their objectives.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2023/RR-2023-L1V2R5-monetary-fiscal-policy.pdf,

High-quality reporting represents the economic reality of the company’s activities during the reporting period and the company’s financial condition at the end of the period., Results quality (commonly referred to as earnings quality) pertains to the earnings and cash generated by the company’s actual economic activities and the resulting financial condition, relative to expectations of current and future financial performance. Quality earnings are regarded as being sustainable, providing a sound platform for forecasts., An aspect of financial reporting quality is the degree to which accounting choices are conservative or aggressive. “Aggressive” typically refers to choices that aim to enhance the company’s reported performance and financial position by inflating the amount of revenues, earnings, and/or operating cash flow reported in the period; or by decreasing expenses for the period and/or the amount of debt reported on the balance sheet., Conservatism in financial reports can result from either (1) accounting standards that specifically require a conservative treatment of a transaction or an event or (2) judgments made by managers when applying accounting standards that result in conservative results., Managers may be motivated to issue less-than-high-quality financial reports in order to mask poor performance, to boost the stock price, to increase personal compensation, and/or to avoid violation of debt covenants., Conditions that are conducive to the issuance of low-quality financial reports include a cultural environment that result in fewer or less transparent financial disclosures, book/tax conformity that shifts emphasis toward legal compliance and away from fair presentation, and limited capital markets regulation., Mechanisms that discipline financial reporting quality include the free market and incentives for companies to minimize cost of capital, auditors, contract provisions specifically tailored to penalize misreporting, and enforcement by regulatory entities., Pro forma earnings (also commonly referred to as non-GAAP or non-IFRS earnings) adjust earnings as reported on the income statement. Pro forma earnings that exclude negative items are a hallmark of aggressive presentation choices., Companies are required to make additional disclosures when presenting any non-GAAP or non-IFRS metric., Managers’ considerable flexibility in choosing their companies’ accounting policies and in formulating estimates provides opportunities for aggressive accounting., Examples of accounting choices that affect earnings and balance sheets include inventory cost flow assumptions, estimates of uncollectible accounts receivable, estimated realizability of deferred tax assets, depreciation method, estimated salvage value of depreciable assets, and estimated useful life of depreciable assets., Cash from operations is a metric of interest to investors that can be enhanced by operating choices, such as stretching accounts payable, and potentially by classification choices.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level1a/RR_2024_L1V3R2_financial_reporting_quality.pdf,

As price falls, the substitution effect tends to cause more of the good to be consumed, but the highly negative income effect overwhelms the substitution effect. Demand curves for Giffen goods are positively sloped., Veblen goods are highly valued high-priced “status” goods; consumers may tend to buy more of a good if its price rises., If income elasticity of demand is positive, the good is a normal good. If income elasticity of demand is negative, the good is an inferior good., Cross-price elasticity of demand is the ratio of the percentage change in quantity demanded of one good to the percentage change in the price of a related good., If cross-price elasticity between two goods is positive, they are substitutes, and if cross-price elasticity between two goods is negative, they are complements., The law of demand states that a decrease in price will cause an increase in quantity demanded., Total product of labor is a short-run concept that is the total quantity that is able to be produced for each level of labor input, holding all other inputs constant., Average product of labor (APL) is the total product of labor divided by number of labor hours., Marginal product of labor (MPL) is the change in total product divided by the change in labor hours. MPL might rise as more labor is added to a fixed amount of capital., The law of diminishing returns dictates that additional output must fall as more and more labor is added to a fixed amount of capital., Production costs increase as input prices rise and fall as inputs become more productive., Short-run total cost (STC) is the total expenditure on fixed capital plus the total expenditure on labor., Short-run marginal cost (SMC) equals the ratio of wage to marginal product of labor (MPL)., Average variable cost (AVC) is the ratio of wage to average product of labor (APL)., Average total cost (ATC) is total cost (TC) divided by the number of units produced., Revenue is price times quantity sold., Marginal revenue (MR) is the ratio of change in revenue to change in output., Firms under conditions of perfect competition have no pricing power and, therefore, face a perfectly horizontal demand curve at the market price. For firms under conditions of perfect competition, price is identical to marginal revenue (MR)., Firms under conditions of imperfect competition face a negatively sloped demand curve and have pricing power. For firms under conditions of imperfect competition, marginal revenue (MR) is less than price., Economic profit equals total revenue (TR) minus total economic cost, whereas accounting profit equals TR minus total accounting cost., Economic cost takes into account the total opportunity cost of all factors of production., Opportunity cost is the next best alternative forgone in making a decision., Maximum economic profit requires that (1) marginal revenue (MR) equals marginal cost (MC) and (2) MC not be falling with output., The breakeven point occurs when total revenue (TR) equals total cost (TC), otherwise stated as the output quantity at which average total cost (ATC) equals price., Shutdown occurs when a firm is better off not operating than continuing to operate., If all fixed costs are sunk costs, then shutdown occurs when the market price falls below minimum average variable cost. After shutdown, the firm incurs only fixed costs and loses less money than it would operating at a price that does not cover variable costs., In the short run, it may be rational for a firm to continue to operate while earning negative economic profit if some unavoidable fixed costs are covered., Economies of scale is defined as decreasing long-run cost per unit as output increases. Diseconomies of scale is defined as increasing long-run cost per unit as output increases., Long-run average total cost is the cost of production per unit of output under conditions in which all inputs are variable., Specialization efficiencies and bargaining power in input price can lead to economies of scale., Bureaucratic and communication breakdowns and bottlenecks that raise input prices can lead to diseconomies of scale., The minimum point on the long-run average total cost curve defines the minimum efficient scale for the firm.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2023/RR-2023-L1V2R1-topics-demand-supply-analysis.pdf,

The investment industry typically refers to four phases of the cycle: recovery, expansion, slowdown, and contraction, with the peak output occurring during the slowdown phase and the trough in output occurring in the recovery phase., Classical cycle refers to fluctuations in the level of economic activity when measured by GDP in volume terms., Growth cycle refers to fluctuations in economic activity around the long-term potential trend growth level with focus on how much actual economic activity is below or above trend growth in economic activity., Growth rate cycle refers to fluctuations in the growth rate of economic activity., Credit cycles describe the changing availability—and pricing—of credit. When the economy is strong or improving, the willingness of lenders to extend credit, and on favorable terms, is high., When the economy is weak or weakening, lenders pull back, or “tighten” credit, by making it less available and more expensive, contributing to asset values and further economic weakness and higher defaults., Credit cycles are relevant due to the importance of credit in the financing of construction and the purchase of property., The extent of business cycle fluctuations and the duration of recessions and recoveries are often shaped by linkages between business and credit cycles., Key economic variables change through the business cycle. The level of business investment shows significant changes over the cycle., Employment levels follow the cycle with a delay as companies initially use overtime before hiring after the onset of recovery and then reduce overtime before reducing employment as the economy passes its peak and enters contraction., Consumer spending, the largest component of output, follows cyclical patterns as workers make decisions based on their levels of income, wage growth, and employment outlook., Spending on consumer durables is the most cyclical consumer activity, followed by services and consumer staples, which are less affected by the cyclicality of the economy., The size of inventories is small relative to the size of the economy, but they have a much greater effect on economic growth than justified by their relatively small aggregate size relative to the economy as a whole., Inventory–sales ratio measures the inventories available for sale to the level of sales. Analysts pay attention to inventories to gauge the position of the economy in the cycle., Neoclassical and Real Business Cycle (RBC) theories focus on fluctuations of aggregate supply (AS). If AS shifts left because of an input price increase or right because of a price decrease or technical progress, the economy will gradually converge to its new equilibrium. Government intervention is generally not necessary because it may exacerbate the fluctuation or delay the convergence to equilibrium., Keynesian theories focus on fluctuations of aggregate demand (AD). If AD shifts left, Keynesians advocate government intervention to restore full employment and avoid a deflationary spiral., Monetarists argue that the timing of the impact from government policies is uncertain, and it is generally better to let the economy find its new equilibrium unassisted while ensuring that the money supply is kept growing at an even pace., Economic indicators are statistics on macroeconomic variables that help in understanding which stage of the business cycle an economy is at. Of particular importance are the leading indicators, which suggest where the economy is likely to be in the near future. No economic indicator is perfect, and many of these statistics are subject to periodic revisions., Leading economic indicators have turning points that usually precede those of the overall economy. They include survey-based indicators, such as (ISM), new orders, and average consumer expectations. They also include average weekly hours, initial claims for unemployment insurance, new building permits, the stock market index, and the difference between yields on short-term and long-term bonds., Coincident economic indicators have turning points that are usually close to those of the overall economy. They are believed to have value for identifying the economy’s present state. They include industrial production indexes, manufacturing and trade sales indexes, aggregate real personal income, and non-agricultural employment., Lagging economic indicators have turning points that take place later than those of the overall economy; they change after a trend has been established. They include average duration of unemployment, inventory–sales ratio, change in unit labor costs, average bank prime lending rate, commercial and industrial loans outstanding, ratio of consumer installment debt to income, and change in consumer price index for services., Policy makers and market practitioners use real-time monitoring of economic and financial variables to continuously assess current conditions and produce a nowcast. Nowcasting produces an estimate of the present state of the economy. It is useful because the actual data on such measures as GDP are only published with delay, after the end of the time period under consideration., Unemployed are those people who are actively seeking employment but are currently without a job., Long-term unemployed are those who have been out of work for a long time (more than three to four months in many countries) but are still looking for a job., Frictionally unemployed are those people who are not working at the time of filling out the statistical survey because they are taking time to search for a job that matches their skills, interests, and other preferences better than what is currently available, or people who have left one job and are about to start another job., There are different types of inflation. Hyperinflation indicates a high (e.g., 100% annual) and increasing rate of inflation; deflation indicates a negative inflation rate (prices decrease); imported inflation is associated with increasing cost of inputs that come from abroad; demand inflation is caused by constraints in production that prevent companies from making as many goods as the market demands (it is sometimes called wartime inflation, because in times of war, goods tend to be rationed)., Inflation is measured by many indexes. Consumer price indexes reflect the prices of a basket of goods and services that is typically purchased by a normal household. Producer price indexes measure the cost of a basket of raw materials, intermediate inputs, and finished products. GDP deflators measure the price of the basket of goods and services produced within an economy in a given year. Core indexes exclude volatile items, such as agricultural products and energy, whose prices tend to vary more than other goods., Price levels are affected by real factors and monetary factors. Real factors include aggregate supply (an increase in supply leads to lower prices) and aggregate demand (an increase in demand leads to higher prices). Monetary factors include the supply of money (i.e., more money circulating, if the economy is in equilibrium, will lead to higher prices) and the velocity of money (i.e., higher velocity, if the economy is in equilibrium, will lead to higher prices)., Economists describe two types of inflation: cost-push, in which rising costs, usually wages, compel businesses to raise prices generally; and demand-pull, in which increasing demand raises prices generally, which then are reflected in a business’s costs as workers demand wake hikes to catch up with the rising cost of living.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level1a/RR_2024_L1V1R13_understanding_business_cycles.pdf,

The degree of product differentiation, the pricing power of the producer, the barriers to entry of new producers, and the level of non-price competition (e.g., advertising) are all low in perfect competition, moderate in monopolistic competition, high in oligopoly, and generally highest in monopoly., A financial analyst must understand the characteristics of market structures in order to better forecast a firm’s future profit stream., The optimal marginal revenue equals marginal cost. However, only in perfect competition does the marginal revenue equal price. In the remaining structures, price generally exceeds marginal revenue because a firm can sell more units only by reducing the per unit price., The quantity sold is highest in perfect competition. The price in perfect competition is usually lowest, but this depends on factors such as demand elasticity and increasing returns to scale (which may reduce the producer’s marginal cost). Monopolists, oligopolists, and producers in monopolistic competition attempt to differentiate their products so that they can charge higher prices., Typically, monopolists sell a smaller quantity at a higher price. Investors may benefit from being shareholders of monopolistic firms that have large margins and substantial positive cash flows., Competitive firms do not earn economic profit. There will be a market compensation for the rental of capital and of management services, but the lack of pricing power implies that there will be no extra margins., While in the short run firms in any market structure can have economic profits, the more competitive a market is and the lower the barriers to entry, the faster the extra profits will fade. In the long run, new entrants shrink margins and push the least efficient firms out of the market., Oligopoly is characterized by the importance of strategic behavior. Firms can change the price, quantity, quality, and advertisement of the product to gain an advantage over their competitors. Several types of equilibrium (e.g., Nash, Cournot, kinked demand curve) may occur that affect the likelihood of each of the incumbents (and potential entrants in the long run) having economic profits. Price wars may be started to force weaker competitors to abandon the market., Measuring market power is complicated. Ideally, econometric estimates of the elasticity of demand and supply should be computed. However, because of the lack of reliable data and the fact that elasticity changes over time (so that past data may not apply to the current situation), regulators and economists often use simpler measures. The concentration ratio is simple, but the HHI, with little more computation required, often produces a better figure for decision making.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level1a/RR_2024_L1V1R12_firms_market_structures.pdf,

A country has a comparative advantage in producing a good if its opportunity cost of producing that good is less than that of its trading partner., Even if a country does not have an absolute advantage in the production of any good, it can gain from trade by producing and exporting the good(s) in which it has a comparative advantage and importing good(s) in which it has a comparative disadvantage., In the Ricardian model of trade, comparative advantage and the pattern of trade are determined by differences in technology between countries. In the Heckscher–Ohlin model of trade, comparative advantage and the pattern of trade are determined by differences in factor endowments between countries. In reality, technology and factor endowments are complementary, not mutually exclusive, determinants of trade patterns., Trade barriers prevent the free flow of goods and services among countries. Governments impose trade barriers for various reasons including: to promote specific developmental objectives, to counteract certain imperfections in the functioning of markets, or to respond to problems facing their economies., For purposes of international trade policy and analysis, a small country is defined as one that cannot affect the world price of traded goods. A large country’s production and/or consumption decisions do alter the relative prices of trade goods., In a small country, trade barriers generate a net welfare loss arising from distortion of production and consumption decisions and the associated inefficient allocation of resources., Trade barriers can generate a net welfare gain in a large country if the gain from improving its terms of trade (higher export prices and lower import prices) more than offsets the loss from the distortion of resource allocations. However, the large country can only gain if it imposes an even larger welfare loss on its trading partner(s)., An import tariff and an import quota have the same effect on price, production, and trade. With a quota, however, some or all of the revenue that would be raised by the equivalent tariff is instead captured by foreign producers (or the foreign government) as quota rents. Thus, the welfare loss suffered by the importing country is generally greater with a quota., A voluntary export restraint is imposed by the exporting country. It has the same impact on the importing country as an import quota from which foreigners capture all of the quota rents., An export subsidy encourages firms to export their product rather than sell it in the domestic market. The distortion of production, consumption, and trade decisions generates a welfare loss. The welfare loss is greater for a large country because increased production and export of the subsidized product reduces its global price—that is, worsens the country’s terms of trade., Capital restrictions are defined as controls placed on foreigners’ ability to own domestic assets and/or domestic residents’ ability to own foreign assets. In contrast to trade restrictions, which limit the openness of goods markets, capital restrictions limit the openness of financial markets., A regional trading bloc is a group of countries who have signed an agreement to reduce and progressively eliminate barriers to trade and movement of factors of production among the members of the bloc. They may or may not have common trade barriers against those countries that are not members of the bloc. In a free trade area all barriers to the flow of goods and services among members are eliminated, but each country maintains its own polices against non-members. A customs union extends the FTA by not only allowing free movement of goods and services among members but also creating a common trade policy against non-members. A common market incorporates all aspects of a customs union and extends it by allowing free movement of factors of production among members. An economic union incorporates all aspects of a common market and requires common economic institutions and coordination of economic policies among members. Members of a monetary union adopt a common currency., They may or may not have common trade barriers against those countries that are not members of the bloc.

An exception to this phenomenon can occur on low-coupon (but not zero-coupon) bonds that are priced at a discount to par value., Assuming no default, premium and discount bond prices are “pulled to par” as maturity nears., A spot rate is the yield-to-maturity on a zero-coupon bond., A yield-to-maturity can be approximated as a weighted average of the underlying spot rates., Between coupon dates, the full (or invoice, or “dirty”) price of a bond is split between the flat (or quoted, or “clean”) price and the accrued interest., Flat prices are quoted to not misrepresent the daily increase in the full price as a result of interest accruals., Accrued interest is calculated as a proportional share of the next coupon payment using either the actual/actual or 30/360 methods to count days., Matrix pricing is used to value illiquid bonds by using prices and yields on comparable securities having the same or similar credit risk, coupon rate, and maturity., The periodicity of an annual interest rate is the number of periods in the year., A yield quoted on a semiannual bond basis is an annual rate for a periodicity of two. It is the yield per semiannual period times two., The general rule for periodicity conversions is that compounding more frequently at a lower annual rate corresponds to compounding less frequently at a higher annual rate., Street convention yields assume payments are made on scheduled dates, neglecting weekends and holidays.The current yield is the annual coupon payment divided by the flat price, thereby neglecting as a measure of the investor’s rate of return the time value of money, any accrued interest, and the gain from buying at a discount or the loss from buying at a premium., The simple yield is like the current yield but includes the straight-line amortization of the discount or premium., The yield-to-worst on a callable bond is the lowest of the yield-to-first-call, yield-to-second-call, and so on, calculated using the call price for the future value and the call date for the number of periods., The option-adjusted yield on a callable bond is the yield-to-maturity after adding the theoretical value of the call option to the price., A floating-rate note (floater, or FRN) maintains a more stable price than a fixed-rate note because interest payments adjust for changes in market interest rates., The quoted margin on a floater is typically the specified yield spread over or under the reference rate, which we refer to as the Market Reference Rate., The discount margin on a floater is the spread required by investors, and to which the quoted margin must be set, for the FRN to trade at par value on a rate reset date., Money market instruments, having one year or less time-to-maturity, are quoted on a discount rate or add-on rate basis., Money market discount rates understate the investor’s rate of return (and the borrower’s cost of funds) because the interest income is divided by the face value or the total amount redeemed at maturity, and not by the amount of the investment., Money market instruments need to be converted to a common basis for analysis., A money market bond equivalent yield is an add-on rate for a 365-day year., The periodicity of a money market instrument is the number of days in the year divided by the number of days to maturity. Therefore, money market instruments with different times-to-maturity have annual rates for different periodicities., In theory, the maturity structure, or term structure, of interest rates is the relationship between yields-to-maturity and times-to-maturity on bonds having the same currency, credit risk, liquidity, tax status, and periodicity., A spot curve is a series of yields-to-maturity on zero-coupon bonds., A frequently used yield curve is a series of yields-to-maturity on coupon bonds., A par curve is a series of yields-to-maturity assuming the bonds are priced at par value., In a cash market, the delivery of the security and cash payment is made on a settlement date within a customary time period after the trade date—for example, “T + 3.”, In a forward market, the delivery of the security and cash payment are made on a predetermined future date., A forward rate is the interest rate on a bond or money market instrument traded in a forward market., An implied forward rate (or forward yield) is the breakeven reinvestment rate linking the return on an investment in a shorter-term zero-coupon bond to the return on an investment in a longer-term zero-coupon bond., An implied forward curve can be calculated from the spot curve., Implied spot rates can be calculated as geometric averages of forward rates., A fixed-income bond can be valued using a market discount rate, a series of spot rates, or a series of forward rates., A bond yield-to-maturity can be separated into a benchmark and a spread., Changes in benchmark rates capture macroeconomic factors that affect all bonds in the market—inflation, economic growth, foreign exchange rates, and monetary and fiscal policy., Changes in spreads typically capture microeconomic factors that affect the particular bond—credit risk, liquidity, and tax effects., Benchmark rates are usually yields-to-maturity on government bonds or fixed rates on interest rate swaps., A G-spread is the spread over or under a government bond rate, and an I-spread is the spread over or under an interest rate swap rate., A G-spread or an I-spread can be based on a specific benchmark rate or on a rate interpolated from the benchmark yield curve., A Z-spread (zero-volatility spread) is based on the entire benchmark spot curve. It is the constant spread that is added to each spot rate such that the present value of the cash flows matches the price of the bond., An option-adjusted spread (OAS) on a callable bond is the Z-spread minus the theoretical value of the embedded call option.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2023/RR-2023-L1V4R12-introduction-fixed-income-valuation.pdf,

In this model, the coefficients and are the population intercept and slope, respectively., The intercept is the expected value of the dependent variable when the independent variable has a value of zero.

"Fixed-Income Markets: Issuance, Trading, and Funding",2023 Curriculum,CFA Program Level I,Fixed Income,"The member should be able to: describe classifications of global fixed-income markets; describe the use of interbank offered rates as reference rates in floating-rate debt; describe mechanisms available for issuing bonds in primary markets; describe secondary markets for bonds; describe securities issued by sovereign governments; describe securities issued by non-sovereign governments, quasi-government entities, and supranational agencies; describe types of debt issued by corporations; describe structured financial instruments; describe short-term funding alternatives available to banks; describe repurchase agreements (repos) and the risks associated with them.","The member should be able to: describe classifications of global fixed-income markets; describe the use of interbank offered rates as reference rates in floating-rate debt; describe mechanisms available for issuing bonds in primary markets; describe secondary markets for bonds; describe securities issued by sovereign governments; describe securities issued by non-sovereign governments, quasi-government entities, and supranational agencies; describe types of debt issued by corporations; describe structured financial instruments; describe short-term funding alternatives available to banks; describe repurchase agreements (repos) and the risks associated with them.","The most widely used ways of classifying fixed-income markets include the type of issuer; the bonds’ credit quality, maturity, currency denomination, and type of coupon; and where the bonds are issued and traded., Based on the type of issuer, the four major bond market sectors are the household, non-financial corporate, government, and financial institution sectors., Investors distinguish between investment-grade and high-yield bond markets based on the issuer’s credit quality., Money markets are where securities with original maturities ranging from overnight to one year are issued and traded, whereas capital markets are where securities with original maturities longer than one year are issued and traded., The majority of bonds are denominated in either euros or US dollars., Investors distinguish between bonds that pay a fixed rate versus a floating rate of interest. The coupon rate of floating-rate bonds is often expressed as a reference rate plus a spread., Interbank offered rates, such as Libor, historically have been the most commonly used reference rates for floating-rate debt and other financial instruments but are being phased out to be replaced by alternative reference rates., Based on where the bonds are issued and traded, investors distinguish between domestic and international bond markets. The latter includes the Eurobond market, which falls outside the jurisdiction of any single country and is characterized by less reporting, regulatory, and tax constraints. Investors also distinguish between developed and emerging bond markets., Investors and investment managers use fixed-income indexes to describe bond markets or sectors and to evaluate performance of investments and investment managers., The largest investors in bonds include central banks; institutional investors, such as pension funds, hedge funds, charitable foundations and endowments, insurance companies, mutual funds and ETFs, and banks; and retail investors, typically by means of indirect investments., Primary markets are markets in which issuers first sell bonds to investors to raise capital. Secondary markets are markets in which existing bonds are subsequently traded among investors., There are two mechanisms for issuing a bond in primary markets: a public offering, in which any member of the public may buy the bonds, or a private placement, in which only an investor or small group of investors may buy the bonds either directly from the issuer or through an investment bank., Public bond issuing mechanisms include underwritten offerings, best-efforts offerings, shelf registrations, and auctions., When an investment bank underwrites a bond issue, it buys the entire issue and takes the risk of reselling it to investors or dealers. In contrast, in a best-efforts offering, the investment bank serves only as a broker and sells the bond issue only if it is able to do so. Underwritten and best-efforts offerings are frequently used in the issuance of corporate bonds., The underwriting process typically includes six phases: the determination of the funding needs, the selection of the underwriter, the structuring and announcement of the bond offering, pricing, issuance, and closing., A shelf registration is a method for issuing securities in which the issuer files a single document with regulators that describes and allows for a range of future issuances., An auction is a public offering method that involves bidding and is helpful both in providing price discovery and in allocating securities. Auctions are frequently used in the issuance of sovereign bonds., Most bonds are traded in OTC markets, and institutional investors are the major buyers and sellers of bonds in secondary markets., Sovereign bonds are issued by national governments primarily for fiscal reasons. These bonds take different names and forms depending on where they are issued, their maturities, and their coupon types. Most sovereign bonds are fixed-rate bonds, although some national governments also issue floating-rate bonds and inflation-linked bonds., Local governments, quasi-government entities, and supranational agencies issue bonds, which are named non-sovereign, quasi-government, and supranational bonds, respectively., Companies raise debt in the form of bilateral loans, syndicated loans, commercial paper, notes, and bonds., Commercial paper is a short-term unsecured security that companies use as a source of short-term and bridge financing. Investors in commercial paper are exposed to credit risk, although defaults are rare. Many issuers roll over their commercial paper on a regular basis., Corporate bonds and notes take different forms depending on the maturities, coupon payment, and principal repayment structures. Important considerations also include collateral backing and contingency provisions., Medium-term notes are securities that are offered continuously to investors by an agent of the issuer. They can have short-term or long-term maturities., The structured finance sector includes asset-backed securities, collateralized debt obligations, and other structured financial instruments. All of these seemingly disparate financial instruments share the common attribute of repackaging risks., Many structured financial instruments are customized instruments that often combine a bond and at least one derivative. The redemption and often the coupons of these structured financial instruments are linked via a formula to the performance of the underlying asset(s). Thus, the bond’s payment features are replaced with non-traditional payoffs derived not from the issuer’s cash flows but from the performance of the underlying asset(s). Capital protected, yield enhancement, participation and leveraged instruments are typical examples of structured financial instruments., Financial institutions have access to additional sources of funds, such as retail deposits, central bank funds, interbank funds, large-denomination negotiable certificates of deposit, and repurchase agreements., A repurchase agreement is similar to a collateralized loan. It involves the sale of a security (the collateral) with a simultaneous agreement by the seller (the borrower) to buy back the same security from the purchaser (the lender) at an agreed-on price in the future. Repurchase agreements are a common source of funding for dealer firms and are also used to borrow securities to implement short positions.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2023/RR-2023-L1V4R11-fixed-income-markets-issuance-trading-funding.pdf,
Understanding Balance Sheets,2023 Curriculum,CFA Program Level I,Financial Reporting and Analysis,"The member should be able to: describe the elements of the balance sheet: assets, liabilities, and equity; describe uses and limitations of the balance sheet in financial analysis; describe alternative formats of balance sheet presentation; distinguish between current and non-current assets and current and non-current liabilities; describe different types of assets and liabilities and the measurement bases of each; describe the components of shareholders’ equity; convert balance sheets to common-size balance sheets and interpret common-size balance sheets; calculate and interpret liquidity and solvency ratios.","The member should be able to: describe the elements of the balance sheet: assets, liabilities, and equity; describe uses and limitations of the balance sheet in financial analysis; describe alternative formats of balance sheet presentation; distinguish between current and non-current assets and current and non-current liabilities; describe different types of assets and liabilities and the measurement bases of each; describe the components of shareholders’ equity; convert balance sheets to common-size balance sheets and interpret common-size balance sheets; calculate and interpret liquidity and solvency ratios.","The balance sheet distinguishes between current and non-current assets and between current and non-current liabilities unless a presentation based on liquidity provides more relevant and reliable information., The concept of liquidity relates to a company’s ability to pay for its near-term operating needs. With respect to a company overall, liquidity refers to the availability of cash to pay those near-term needs. With respect to a particular asset or liability, liquidity refers to its “nearness to cash.”, Some assets and liabilities are measured on the basis of fair value and some are measured at historical cost. Notes to financial statements provide information that is helpful in assessing the comparability of measurement bases across companies., Assets expected to be liquidated or used up within one year or one operating cycle of the business, whichever is greater, are classified as current assets. Assets not expected to be liquidated or used up within one year or one operating cycle of the business, whichever is greater, are classified as non-current assets., Liabilities expected to be settled or paid within one year or one operating cycle of the business, whichever is greater, are classified as current liabilities. Liabilities not expected to be settled or paid within one year or one operating cycle of the business, whichever is greater, are classified as non-current liabilities., Trade receivables, also referred to as accounts receivable, are amounts owed to a company by its customers for products and services already delivered. Receivables are reported net of the allowance for doubtful accounts., Inventories are physical products that will eventually be sold to the company’s customers, either in their current form (finished goods) or as inputs into a process to manufacture a final product (raw materials and work-in-process). Inventories are reported at the lower of cost or net realizable value. If the net realizable value of a company’s inventory falls below its carrying amount, the company must write down the value of the inventory and record an expense., Inventory cost is based on specific identification or estimated using the first-in, first-out or weighted average cost methods. Some accounting standards (including US GAAP but not IFRS) also allow last-in, first-out as an additional inventory valuation method., Accounts payable, also called trade payables, are amounts that a business owes its vendors for purchases of goods and services., Deferred revenue (also known as unearned revenue) arises when a company receives payment in advance of delivery of the goods and services associated with the payment received., Property, plant, and equipment (PPE) are tangible assets that are used in company operations and expected to be used over more than one fiscal period. Examples of tangible assets include land, buildings, equipment, machinery, furniture, and natural resources such as mineral and petroleum resources., IFRS provide companies with the choice to report PPE using either a historical cost model or a revaluation model. US GAAP permit only the historical cost model for reporting PPE., Depreciation is the process of recognizing the cost of a long-lived asset over its useful life. (Land is not depreciated.), Under IFRS, property used to earn rental income or capital appreciation is considered to be an investment property. IFRS provide companies with the choice to report an investment property using either a historical cost model or a fair value model., Intangible assets refer to identifiable non-monetary assets without physical substance. Examples include patents, licenses, and trademarks. For each intangible asset, a company assesses whether the useful life is finite or indefinite., An intangible asset with a finite useful life is amortised on a systematic basis over the best estimate of its useful life, with the amortisation method and useful-life estimate reviewed at least annually. Impairment principles for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are the same as for PPE., An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortised. Instead, it is tested for impairment at least annually., For internally generated intangible assets, IFRS require that costs incurred during the research phase must be expensed. Costs incurred in the development stage can be capitalized as intangible assets if certain criteria are met, including technological feasibility, the ability to use or sell the resulting asset, and the ability to complete the project., The most common intangible asset that is not a separately identifiable asset is goodwill, which arises in business combinations. Goodwill is not amortised; instead it is tested for impairment at least annually., Financial instruments are contracts that give rise to both a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. In general, there are two basic alternative ways that financial instruments are measured: fair value or amortised cost. For financial instruments measured at fair value, there are two basic alternatives in how net changes in fair value are recognized: as profit or loss on the income statement, or as other comprehensive income (loss) which bypasses the income statement., Typical long-term financial liabilities include loans (i.e., borrowings from banks) and notes or bonds payable (i.e., fixed-income securities issued to investors). Liabilities such as bonds issued by a company are usually reported at amortised cost on the balance sheet., Deferred tax liabilities arise from temporary timing differences between a company’s income as reported for tax purposes and income as reported for financial statement purposes., Six potential components that comprise the owners’ equity section of the balance sheet include: contributed capital, preferred shares, treasury shares, retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income, and non-controlling interest., The statement of changes in equity reflects information about the increases or decreases in each component of a company’s equity over a period., Vertical common-size analysis of the balance sheet involves stating each balance sheet item as a percentage of total assets., Balance sheet ratios include liquidity ratios (measuring the company’s ability to meet its short-term obligations) and solvency ratios (measuring the company’s ability to meet long-term and other obligations).",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2023/RR-2023-L1V3R2-understanding-balance-sheets.pdf,

The reported interest expense on bonds is based on the effective interest rate., Future cash payments on bonds usually include periodic interest payments (made at the stated interest rate or coupon rate) and the principal amount at maturity., When the market rate of interest equals the coupon rate for the bonds, the bonds will sell at par (i.e., at a price equal to the face value). When the market rate of interest is higher than the bonds’ coupon rate, the bonds will sell at a discount. When the market rate of interest is lower than the bonds’ coupon rate, the bonds will sell at a premium., An issuer amortises any issuance discount or premium on bonds over the life of the bonds., If a company redeems bonds before maturity, it reports a gain or loss on debt extinguishment computed as the net carrying amount of the bonds (including bond issuance costs under IFRS) less the amount required to redeem the bonds., Debt covenants impose restrictions on borrowers, such as limitations on future borrowing or requirements to maintain a minimum debt-to-equity ratio., The carrying amount of bonds is typically the amortised historical cost, which can differ from their fair value., Companies are required to disclose the fair value of financial liabilities, including debt. Although permitted to do so, few companies opt to report debt at fair values on the balance sheet.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2023/RR-2023-L1V3R8-noncurrent-long-term-liabilities.pdf,

The coupon rate can be a fixed rate or a floating rate. Bonds may offer annual, semi-annual, quarterly, or monthly coupon payments depending on the type of bond and where the bond is issued., Bonds can be issued in any currency. Such bonds as dual-currency bonds and currency option bonds are connected to two currencies., The yield-to-maturity is the discount rate that equates the present value of the bond’s future cash flows until maturity to its price. Yield-to-maturity can be considered an estimate of the market’s expectation for the bond’s return., A plain vanilla bond has a known cash flow pattern. It has a fixed maturity date and pays a fixed rate of interest over the bond’s life., The bond indenture or trust deed is the legal contract that describes the form of the bond, the issuer’s obligations, and the investor’s rights. The indenture is usually held by a financial institution called a trustee, which performs various duties specified in the indenture., The issuer is identified in the indenture by its legal name and is obligated to make timely payments of interest and repayment of principal., For asset-backed securities, the legal obligation to repay bondholders often lies with a separate legal entity—that is, a bankruptcy-remote vehicle that uses the assets as guarantees to back a bond issue., How the issuer intends to service the debt and repay the principal should be described in the indenture. The source of repayment proceeds varies depending on the type of bond., Collateral backing is a way to alleviate credit risk. Secured bonds are backed by assets or financial guarantees pledged to ensure debt payment. Examples of collateral-backed bonds include collateral trust bonds, equipment trust certificates, mortgage-backed securities, and covered bonds., Credit enhancement can be internal or external. Examples of internal credit enhancement include subordination, overcollateralization, and reserve accounts. A bank guarantee, a surety bond, a letter of credit, and a cash collateral account are examples of external credit enhancement., Bond covenants are legally enforceable rules that borrowers and lenders agree on at the time of a new bond issue. Affirmative covenants enumerate what issuers are required to do, whereas negative covenants enumerate what issuers are prohibited from doing., An important consideration for investors is where the bonds are issued and traded, because it affects the laws, regulation, and tax status that apply. Bonds issued in a country in local currency are domestic bonds if they are issued by entities incorporated in the country and foreign bonds if they are issued by entities incorporated in another country. Eurobonds are issued internationally, outside the jurisdiction of any single country and are subject to a lower level of listing, disclosure, and regulatory requirements than domestic or foreign bonds. Global bonds are issued in the Eurobond market and at least one domestic market at the same time., Although some bonds may offer special tax advantages, as a general rule, interest is taxed at the ordinary income tax rate. Some countries also implement a capital gains tax. There may be specific tax provisions for bonds issued at a discount or bought at a premium, An amortizing bond is a bond whose payment schedule requires periodic payment of interest and repayment of principal. This differs from a bullet bond, whose entire payment of principal occurs at maturity. The amortizing bond’s outstanding principal amount is reduced to zero by the maturity date for a fully amortized bond, but a balloon payment is required at maturity to retire the bond’s outstanding principal amount for a partially amortized bond., Sinking fund agreements provide another approach to the periodic retirement of principal, in which an amount of the bond’s principal outstanding amount is usually repaid each year throughout the bond’s life or after a specified date., A floating-rate note, or floater, is a bond whose coupon is set based on a market reference rate (MRR) plus a spread. FRNs can be floored, capped, or collared. An inverse FRN is a bond whose coupon has an inverse relationship to the reference rate., Other coupon payment structures include bonds with step-up coupons, which pay coupons that increase by specified amounts on specified dates; bonds with credit-linked coupons, which change when the issuer’s credit rating changes; bonds with payment-in-kind coupons, which allow the issuer to pay coupons with additional amounts of the bond issue rather than in cash; and bonds with deferred coupons, which pay no coupons in the early years following the issue but higher coupons thereafter., The payment structures for index-linked bonds vary considerably among countries. A common index-linked bond is an inflation-linked bond, or linker, whose coupon payments and/or principal repayments are linked to a price index. Index-linked payment structures include zero-coupon-indexed bonds, interest-indexed bonds, capital-indexed bonds, and indexed-annuity bonds., Common types of bonds with embedded options include callable bonds, putable bonds, and convertible bonds. These options are “embedded” in the sense that there are provisions provided in the indenture that grant either the issuer or the bondholder certain rights affecting the disposal or redemption of the bond. They are not separately traded securities., Callable bonds give the issuer the right to buy bonds back prior to maturity, thereby raising the reinvestment risk for the bondholder. For this reason, callable bonds have to offer a higher yield and sell at a lower price than otherwise similar non-callable bonds to compensate the bondholders for the value of the call option to the issuer., Putable bonds give the bondholder the right to sell bonds back to the issuer prior to maturity. Putable bonds offer a lower yield and sell at a higher price than otherwise similar non-putable bonds to compensate the issuer for the value of the put option to the bondholders., A convertible bond gives the bondholder the right to convert the bond into common shares of the issuing company. Because this option favors the bondholder, convertible bonds offer a lower yield and sell at a higher price than otherwise similar non-convertible bonds.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2023/RR-2023-L1V4R10-fixed-income-securities-defining-elements.pdf,

Exhaustive events cover or contain all possible outcomes., The two defining properties of a probability are, first, that 0 ≤ P(E) ≤ 1 (where P(E) denotes the probability of an event E), and second, that the sum of the probabilities of any set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive events equals 1., A probability estimated from data as a relative frequency of occurrence is an empirical probability. A probability drawing on personal or subjective judgment is a subjective probability. A probability obtained based on logical analysis is an a priori probability., A probability of an event E, P(E), can be stated as odds for E = P(E)/[1 − P(E)] or odds against E = [1 − P(E)]/P(E)., Probabilities that are inconsistent create profit opportunities, according to the Dutch Book Theorem., A probability of an event not conditioned on another event is an unconditional probability. The unconditional probability of an event A is denoted P(A). Unconditional probabilities are also called marginal probabilities., A probability of an event given (conditioned on) another event is a conditional probability. The probability of an event A given an event B is denoted P(A | B), and P(A | B) = P(AB)/P(B), P(B) ≠ 0., The probability of both A and B occurring is the joint probability of A and B, denoted P(AB)., The multiplication rule for probabilities is P(AB) = P(A | B)P(B)., The probability that A or B occurs, or both occur, is denoted by P(A or B)., The addition rule for probabilities is P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) − P(AB)., When events are independent, the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of occurrence of the other event. Otherwise, the events are dependent., The multiplication rule for independent events states that if A and B are independent events, P(AB) = P(A)P(B). The rule generalizes in similar fashion to more than two events., According to the total probability rule, if S 1, S 2, …, Sn are mutually exclusive and exhaustive scenarios or events, then P(A) = P(A | S 1)P(S 1) + P(A | S 2)P(S 2) + … + P(A | Sn )P(Sn )., The expected value of a random variable is a probability-weighted average of the possible outcomes of the random variable. For a random variable X, the expected value of X is denoted E(X)., The total probability rule for expected value states that E(X) = E(X | S 1)P(S 1) + E(X | S 2)P(S 2) + … + E(X | Sn )P(Sn ), where S 1, S 2, …, Sn are mutually exclusive and exhaustive scenarios or events., The variance of a random variable is the expected value (the probability-weighted average) of squared deviations from the random variable’s expected value E(X): σ2(X) = E{[X − E(X)]2}, where σ2(X) stands for the variance of X., Variance is a measure of dispersion about the mean. Increasing variance indicates increasing dispersion. Variance is measured in squared units of the original variable., Standard deviation is the positive square root of variance. Standard deviation measures dispersion (as does variance), but it is measured in the same units as the variable., Covariance is a measure of the co-movement between random variables., The covariance between two random variables Ri and Rj in a forward-looking sense is the expected value of the cross-product of the deviations of the two random variables from their respective means: Cov(Ri ,Rj ) = E{[Ri − E(Ri )][Rj − E(Rj )]}. The covariance of a random variable with itself is its own variance., The historical or sample covariance between two random variables Ri and Rj based on a sample of past data of size n is the average value of the product of the deviations of observations on two random variables from their sample means: Cov ( R i , R j ) = ∑ i = 1 n ( R i , t − R ¯ i ) ( R j , t − R ¯ j ) / ( n − 1 ), Correlation is a number between −1 and +1 that measures the co-movement (linear association) between two random variables: ρ(Ri ,Rj ) = Cov(Ri ,Rj )/[σ(Ri ) σ(Rj )]., If two variables have a very strong linear relation, then the absolute value of their correlation will be close to 1. If two variables have a weak linear relation, then the absolute value of their correlation will be close to 0., If the correlation coefficient is positive, the two variables are directly related; if the correlation coefficient is negative, the two variables are inversely related., To calculate the variance of return on a portfolio of n assets, the inputs needed are the n expected returns on the individual assets, n variances of return on the individual assets, and n(n − 1)/2 distinct covariances., Portfolio variance of return is σ 2 ( R p ) = ∑ i = 1 n ∑ j = 1 n w i w j Cov ( R i , R j ) ., The calculation of covariance in a forward-looking sense requires the specification of a joint probability function, which gives the probability of joint occurrences of values of the two random variables., When two random variables are independent, the joint probability function is the product of the individual probability functions of the random variables., Bayes’ formula is a method for updating probabilities based on new information., Bayes’ formula is expressed as follows: Updated probability of event given the new information = [(Probability of the new information given event)/(Unconditional probability of the new information)] × Prior probability of event., The multiplication rule of counting says, for example, that if the first step in a process can be done in 10 ways, the second step, given the first, can be done in 5 ways, and the third step, given the first two, can be done in 7 ways, then the steps can be carried out in (10)(5)(7) = 350 ways., The number of ways to assign every member of a group of size n to n slots is n! = n (n − 1) (n − 2)(n − 3) … 1. (By convention, 0! = 1.), The number of ways that n objects can be labeled with k different labels, with n 1 of the first type, n 2 of the second type, and so on, with n 1 + n 2 + … + nk = n, is given by n!/(n 1!n 2! … nk !). This expression is the multinomial formula., A special case of the multinomial formula is the combination formula. The number of ways to choose r objects from a total of n objects, when the order in which the r objects are listed does not matter, is n C r = ( n r ) = n ! ( n − r ) ! r !, The number of ways to choose r objects from a total of n objects, when the order in which the r objects are listed does matter, is n P r = n ! ( n − r ) !

Common characteristics among these investors include a large scale (i.e., asset size), a long-term investment horizon, regulatory constraints, a clearly defined governance framework, and principal–agent issues., Institutional investors typically codify their mission, investment objectives, and guidelines in an Investment Policy Statement (IPS)., Four common investment approaches to managing portfolios used by institutional investors are the Norway model, the Endowment model, the Canada model, and the Liability Driven Investing (LDI) model., There are two main types of pension plans: defined benefit (DB), in which a plan sponsor commits to paying a specified retirement benefit; and defined contribution (DC), in which contributions are defined but the ultimate retirement benefit is not specified or guaranteed by the plan sponsor., Pension plan stakeholders include the employer, employees, retirees, unions, management, the investment committee and/or board of directors, and shareholders., The key elements in the calculation of DB plan liabilities are as follows: Service/tenure: The higher the service years, the higher the retirement benefit. Salary/earnings: The higher the salary over the measurement period, the higher the retirement benefit. Mortality/longevity: The longer the participant’s expected life span, the higher the plan sponsor’s liability. Vesting: Lower turnover results in higher vesting, increasing the plan sponsor’s liabilities. Discount rate: A higher discount rate reduces the present value of the plan sponsor’s liabilities., Service/tenure: The higher the service years, the higher the retirement benefit., Salary/earnings: The higher the salary over the measurement period, the higher the retirement benefit., Mortality/longevity: The longer the participant’s expected life span, the higher the plan sponsor’s liability., Vesting: Lower turnover results in higher vesting, increasing the plan sponsor’s liabilities., Discount rate: A higher discount rate reduces the present value of the plan sponsor’s liabilities., DB plan liquidity needs are driven by the following: Proportion of active employees relative to retirees: More mature pension funds have higher liquidity needs. Age of workforce: Liquidity needs rise as the age of the workforce increases. Plan funded status: If the plan is well funded, the sponsor may reduce contributions, generating a need to hold higher balances of liquid assets to pay benefits. Flexibility: Ability of participants to switch among the sponsor’s plans or to withdraw from the plan., Proportion of active employees relative to retirees: More mature pension funds have higher liquidity needs., Age of workforce: Liquidity needs rise as the age of the workforce increases., Plan funded status: If the plan is well funded, the sponsor may reduce contributions, generating a need to hold higher balances of liquid assets to pay benefits., Flexibility: Ability of participants to switch among the sponsor’s plans or to withdraw from the plan., Pension plans are subject to significant and evolving regulatory constraints designed to ensure the integrity, adequacy, and sustainability of the pension system. Some incentives, such as tax exemption, are only granted to plans that meet these regulatory requirements. Notable differences in legal, regulatory, and tax considerations can lead to differences in plan design from one country to another or from one group to another (e.g., public plans vs. corporate plans)., The following risk considerations affect the way DB plans are managed: Plan funded status Sponsor financial strength Interactions between the sponsor’s business and the fund’s investments Plan design Workforce characteristics, Plan funded status, Sponsor financial strength, Interactions between the sponsor’s business and the fund’s investments, Plan design, Workforce characteristics, An examination of pension fund asset allocations shows very large differences in average asset allocations by country and within a country despite these plans seeking to achieve similar goals. Such inter- and intra-national differences are driven by many factors, including the differences in legal, regulatory, accounting, and tax constraints; the investment objectives, risk appetites, and investment views of the stakeholders; the liabilities to and demographics of the ultimate beneficiaries; the availability of suitable investment opportunities; and the expected cost of living in retirement., The major types of sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) follow: Budget Stabilization funds: Set up to insulate the budget and economy from commodity price volatility and external shocks. Development funds: Established to allocate resources to priority socioeconomic projects, usually infrastructure. Savings funds: Intended to share wealth across generations by transforming non-renewable assets into diversified financial assets. Reserve funds: Intended to reduce the negative carry costs of holding foreign currency reserves or to earn higher return on ample reserves. Pension Reserve funds: Set up to meet identified future outflows with respect to pension-related, contingent-type liabilities on governments’ balance sheets., Budget Stabilization funds: Set up to insulate the budget and economy from commodity price volatility and external shocks., Development funds: Established to allocate resources to priority socioeconomic projects, usually infrastructure., Savings funds: Intended to share wealth across generations by transforming non-renewable assets into diversified financial assets., Reserve funds: Intended to reduce the negative carry costs of holding foreign currency reserves or to earn higher return on ample reserves., Pension Reserve funds: Set up to meet identified future outflows with respect to pension-related, contingent-type liabilities on governments’ balance sheets., Stakeholders of SWFs include the country’s citizens, the government, external asset managers, and the SWF’s management, investment committee and board of directors., Given their mission of intergenerational wealth transfer, SWFs do not generally have clearly defined liabilities, so do not typically pursue asset/liability matching strategies used by other institutional investor types., Sovereign wealth funds have differing liquidity needs. Budget stabilization funds require the most liquidity, followed by reserve funds. At the other end of the spectrum are savings funds with low liquidity needs, followed by pension reserve funds., The investment objectives of SWFs are often clearly articulated in the legislative instruments that create them. They are often tax free in their home country, though must take foreign taxation into consideration. Given their significant asset sizes and the nature of their stakeholders, SWFs have aimed to increase transparency regarding their investment activities. In this regard, the Santiago Principles are a form of self-regulation., The typical asset allocation by SWF type shows budget stabilization funds are invested mainly in bonds and cash given their liquidity needs. Reserve Funds invest in equities and alternatives but maintain a significant allocation of bonds for liquidity. Savings funds and pension reserve funds hold relatively higher allocations of equities and alternatives because of their longer-term liabilities., Endowments and foundations typically invest to maintain purchasing power while financing their supporting university (endowments) or making grants (foundations) in perpetuity—based on the notion of intergenerational equity. Endowments and foundations usually have a formal spending policy that determines how much is paid out annually to support their mission. This future stream of payouts represents their liabilities. For endowments, other liability-related factors to be considered when setting investment policy are: 1) the ability to raise additional funds from donors/alumni, 2) the percentage of the university’s operating budget provided by the endowment, and 3) the ability to issue debt., Foundations and endowments typically enjoy tax-exempt status and face relatively little regulation compared to other types of institutional investors., Foundations face less flexible spending rules compared to endowments; foundations in the US are legally mandated to pay out 5% of their assets annually to maintain tax-exempt status. Endowments and foundations have relatively low liquidity needs. However, foundations have somewhat higher liquidity needs (vs. endowments), because they 1) typically pay out slightly more as a percentage of assets, and 2) finance the entire operating budget of the organization they support., Endowments and foundations typically have a long-term real return objective of about 5% consistent with their spending policies. This real return objective, and a desire to maintain purchasing power, results in endowments and foundations making significant allocations to real assets. In general, endowments and foundations invest heavily in private asset classes and hedge funds and have relatively small allocations to fixed income., Banking and insurance companies manage both portfolio assets and institutional liabilities to achieve an extremely high probability that obligations on deposits, guarantees, derivatives, policyholder claims, and other liabilities will be paid in full and on time., Banking and insurance companies have perpetual time horizons. Strategically, their goal is to maximize net present value to capital holders; tactically, this may be achieved by liability driven investing (LDI) over intermediate and shorter horizons., Financial institutions are highly regulated because of their importance to the non-financial, or real, sectors of the economy. Such institutions are also regulated in order to minimize contagion risk rippling throughout the financial and real sectors., The underlying premise of regulation is that an institution’s capital must be adequate to absorb shocks to both asset and liability values. This implies limiting the volatility of value of the institution’s shareholder capital., The volatility of shareholder capital can be managed by (a) reducing the price volatility of portfolio investments, loans, and derivatives; (b) lowering the volatility from unexpected shocks to claims, deposits, guarantees, and other liabilities; (c) limiting leverage; and (d) attempting to achieve positive correlation between changes in the value of assets and liabilities., Ample liquidity, diversification of portfolio and other assets, high investment quality, transparency, stable funding, duration management, diversification of insurance underwriting risks, and monetary limits on guarantees, funding commitments, and insurance claims are some of the ways management and regulators attempt to achieve low volatility of shareholder capital value.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level3/RR_2024_L3V5R1_portfolio_management_for_institutional_investors.pdf,

Risk tolerance is the inverse of risk aversion. Risk capacity is the ability to accept financial risk. Risk perception is an individual’s subjective assessment of the risk involved in an investment decision’s outcome., Wealth managers often utilize questionnaires to assess clients’ risk tolerance. The result of a risk tolerance questionnaire, typically a numerical score, is often used as an input in the investment planning process., Wealth managers need both technical skills and non-technical (“soft”) skills in their advisory roles. Technical skills include capital markets proficiency, portfolio construction ability, financial planning knowledge, quantitative skills, technology skills, and in some situations, foreign language fluency. Soft skills include communication skills, social skills, education/coaching skills, and business development and sales skills., Capital sufficiency analysis, also known as capital needs analysis, is the process by which a wealth manager determines whether a client has, or is likely to accumulate, sufficient financial resources to meet his or her objectives., Two methods for evaluating capital sufficiency are deterministic forecasting and Monte Carlo simulation., Wealth managers use several different methods to analyze a client’s retirement goals, including mortality tables, annuities, and Monte Carlo simulation., An investment policy statement (IPS) for an individual includes the following parts: background and investment objective(s); investment parameters (risk tolerance and investment time horizon); asset class preferences; other investment preferences (liquidity and constraints); portfolio asset allocation; portfolio management (discretionary authority, rebalancing, tactical changes, implementation); duties and responsibilities; and an appendix for additional details., Two primary approaches to constructing a client portfolio are a traditional approach and a goals-based investing approach., Portfolio reporting involves periodically providing clients with information about their investment portfolio and performance. Portfolio review refers to meetings or phone conversations between a wealth manager and a client to discuss the client’s investment strategy. The key difference between portfolio reporting and portfolio review is that the wealth manager is more actively engaged in a review., The success of an investment program involves achieving client goals, following a consistent process, and realizing favorable portfolio performance., Ethical considerations for private wealth managers include “know your customer” (KYC), fiduciary duty and suitability, confidentiality, and conflicts of interest., Several global regulations have relevance for private wealth managers., Key private wealth segments include mass affluent, high net worth, and ultra high net worth., Robo-advisors have emerged in the mass affluent client segment.

The composite return is the weighted average of the return of all portfolios in the composite., All discretionary, fee-paying, segregated accounts must be included in at least one composite. All discretionary, fee-paying pooled funds must be included in any composite for which they meet the composite definition. A portfolio is discretionary if the firm is able to implement the intended investment strategy., Firms must formulate, document, and adhere to composite- and pooled fund–specific policies for the treatment of external cash flows and to adhere to those policies consistently., The GIPS standards mandate the use of certain calculation methodologies to facilitate comparability of results among firms. Time-weighted returns are required for all portfolios except portfolios meeting certain criteria., Money-weighted returns may be presented instead of time-weighted returns if the firm has control over the external cash flows into the portfolios in the composite or the pooled fund and at least one of the following conditions is met: the portfolios in the composite are (or the pooled fund is): 1) closed-end; 2) fixed life; 3) fixed commitment; or 4) have illiquid investments as a significant part of the investment strategy., Returns for periods of less than one year must not be annualized., Returns from cash and cash equivalents must be included in all total return calculations., Returns must be calculated after the deduction of transaction costs., Assets must be valued using a fair value methodology. If objective, observable, unadjusted quoted market prices for identical investments in active markets on the measurement date are available, they must be used. If they are not available, firms may use, in this order: (1) quoted prices for similar investments in markets that are active; (2) quoted prices for identical or similar investments in markets that are not active; (3) market-based inputs, other than quoted prices, that are observable for the investment; or (4) subjective, unobservable inputs., A firm must have a clear, written definition of discretion that is consistently applied., Firms may not link the theoretical performance of simulated or model portfolios with actual performance., GIPS Composite Reports that present TWRs must include the following key items: at least five years of annual performance (unless the composite has been in existence for a shorter period), building to a minimum of 10 years of returns; composite and benchmark annual returns for all years; the number of portfolios (if six or more) in the composite at each period end; the amount of assets in the composite; the amount of total firm assets at the end of each period; a measure of internal dispersion of individual portfolio returns for each annual period and, where monthly returns are available; and the three-year annualized ex post standard deviation of the composite and of the benchmark as of each annual period end., at least five years of annual performance (unless the composite has been in existence for a shorter period), building to a minimum of 10 years of returns;, composite and benchmark annual returns for all years;, the number of portfolios (if six or more) in the composite at each period end;, the amount of assets in the composite;, the amount of total firm assets at the end of each period;, a measure of internal dispersion of individual portfolio returns for each annual period and, where monthly returns are available; and, the three-year annualized ex post standard deviation of the composite and of the benchmark as of each annual period end., Performance from a past firm or affiliation may be linked to the performance of the new or acquiring firm if (1) substantially all the investment decision makers are employed by the new or acquiring firm, (2) the decision-making process remains substantially intact and independent within the new or acquiring firm, (3) the new or acquiring firm has records that document and support the reported performance, and (4) there is no break in the track record between the past firm or affiliation and the new or acquiring firm., Verification provides assurance on whether the firm’s policies and procedures related to composite and pooled fund maintenance, as well as the calculation, presentation, and distribution of performance have been designed in compliance with the GIPS standards and have been implemented on a firm-wide basis., Verifiers must determine if the firm satisfies the GIPS standards requirements with respect to recordkeeping, policies and procedures, the definition of the firm, the completeness of the list of composites and limited distribution pooled fund descriptions, and the calculation of total firm assets., A verification report may be issued only with respect to the whole firm.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2023/RR-2023-L3V6R5-overview-global-investment-performance-standards.pdf,

A Type II error is not hiring or firing a manager who subsequently outperforms, or performs in line with, expectations—that is, not rejecting the null hypothesis when it is incorrect., The manager search and selection process has three broad components: the universe, a quantitative analysis of the manager’s performance track record, and a qualitative analysis of the manager’s investment process. The qualitative analysis includes both investment due diligence and operational due diligence., Capture ratio measures the asymmetry of returns, and a ratio greater than 1 indicates greater participation in rising versus falling markets. Drawdown is the loss incurred in any continuous period of negative returns., The investment philosophy is the foundation of the investment process. The philosophy outlines the set of assumptions about the factors that drive performance and the manager’s beliefs about their ability to successfully exploit these sources of return. The investment manager should have a clear and concise investment philosophy. It is important to evaluate these assumptions and the role they play in the investment process to understand how the strategy will behave over time and across market environments. The investment process has to be consistent and appropriate for the philosophy, and the investment personnel need to possess sufficient expertise and experience to effectively execute the investment process., Style analysis, understanding the manager’s risk exposures relative to the benchmark, is an important component of performance appraisal and manager selection, helping to define the universe of suitable managers., Returns-based style analysis is a top-down approach that involves estimating the risk exposures from an actual return series for a given period. Although RBSA adds an additional analytical step, the analysis is straightforward and should identify the important drivers of return and risk factors for the period analyzed. It can be estimated even for complicated strategies and is comparable across managers and through time. The disadvantage is that RBSA is an imprecise tool, attributing performance to an unchanging average portfolio during the period that might not reflect the current or future portfolio exposures., Holdings-based style analysis is a bottom-up approach that estimates the risk exposures from the actual securities held in the portfolio at a point in time. HBSA allows for the estimation of current risk factors and should identify all important drivers of return and risk factors, be comparable across managers and through time, and provide an accurate view of the manager’s risk exposures. The disadvantages are the additional computational effort, dependence on the degree of transparency provided by the manager, and the possibility that accuracy may be compromised by stale pricing and window dressing., The prospectus, private placement memorandum, and/or limited partnership agreement are, in essence, the contract between the investor and the manager, outlining each party’s rights and responsibilities. The provisions are liquidity terms and fees. Limited liquidity reduce the investor’s flexibility to adjust portfolio allocations in light of changing market conditions or investor circumstances. On the other hand, limited liquidity allows the funds to take long-term views and hold less liquid securities with reduced risk of having to divest assets at inopportune times in response to redemption requests. A management fee lowers the level of realized return without affecting the standard deviation, whereas a performance fee has the added effect of lowering the realized standard deviation. The preference is for more-linear compensation to reduce the incentives to change the portfolio’s risk profile at inflection points., The choice between individual separate accounts and pooled (or commingled) vehicles is dependent upon the consistency with the investment process, the suitability for the investor IPS, and whether the benefits outweigh the additional costs., Investment management fees take one of two forms: a fixed percentage fee based on assets under management or a performance-based fee which charges a percentage of the portfolio’s total return or excess return over a benchmark or hurdle rate. Performance-based fees work to align the interests of managers and investors because both parties share in investment results. Most managers that charge a performance fee also charge some level of fixed percentage fee to aid business continuity efforts. Fee structures must be designed carefully to avoid favoring one party over the other.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level3/RR_2024_L3V5R4_investment_manager_selection.pdf,

Long-term capital gains are typically taxed at a lower rate than other forms of income., Income from real estate investments may be reduced by maintenance, interest, and depreciation expenses., Private clients often have a mix of taxable, tax-deferred, and tax-exempt investment accounts. Returns in tax-deferred and tax-exempt accounts compound using the pre-tax rate of return. Tax-deferred accounts pay tax only when assets are withdrawn from the account. Taxable accounts compound using the after-tax rate of return., Broadly speaking, countries may operate under one of three tax regimes: tax havens, territorial tax systems, and worldwide tax systems. A tax haven has no or very low tax rates for foreign investors. A territorial regime taxes only locally-sourced income. A worldwide tax regime taxes all income, regardless of its source., The Common Reporting Standard exists to ensure exchange of financial account information to combat tax evasion. The United States uses FATCA, the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, for the same purpose., Equity portfolios are often more tax efficient than strategies that rely on derivatives, real assets, or taxable fixed income. Higher-yield and higher-turnover strategies tend to be less tax efficient., The tax considerations associated with alternative asset classes are more complicated than those associated with stocks and bonds., Measures of tax efficiency include after-tax holding period return, annualized after-tax return, after-tax post-liquidation return, after-tax excess return, and the tax-efficiency ratio., Asset location is the process for determining which assets should be held in each type of account. A general rule of thumb is to put tax-efficient assets in the taxable account and tax-inefficient assets in the tax-exempt or tax-deferred account. The actual solution may differ depending on the strategy and the investor’s horizon., It is typically better to make withdrawals from the taxable account first and then from the tax-deferred accounts. Under progressive tax regimes, it may be more tax efficient to withdraw from the retirement account first until the lowest tax brackets have been fully utilized., Tax avoidance is the legal activity of understanding the tax laws and finding approaches that avoid or minimize taxation. Tax evasion is the illegal concealment and non-payment of taxes that are otherwise due., Tax avoidance strategies include holding assets in a tax-exempt account versus a taxable account, investing in tax-exempt bonds instead of taxable bonds, holding assets long enough to qualify for long-term capital gains treatment, and holding dividend-paying stocks long enough to pay the more favorable tax rate. Tax-deferral strategies include limiting portfolio turnover and the consequent realization of capital gains and tax loss harvesting., The structure of the investment vehicle in which a client’s assets are held may affect the tax liability and the adviser’s ability to manage the client portfolio in a tax-aware manner. In a partnership, the income, realized capital gains, and realized capital losses are passed through to the investors, who are then responsible for any tax liability. In a mutual fund, the income and realized capital gains (but not losses) are passed through to the investors. The taxation of capital gains varies by jurisdiction., Potential capital gain exposure (PCGE) can be used to gauge the amount of tax liability embedded in a mutual fund., Exchange-traded funds are very tax efficient. Separately-managed accounts offer the most flexibility for tax management., Tax loss harvesting is a technique whereby the manager realizes a loss that can be used to offset gains or other income. Tax loss harvesting requires diligent tax lot accounting., Common methods of tax lot accounting are first in, first out (FIFO); last in, first out (LIFO); and highest in, first out (HIFO)., A concentrated position subjects the portfolio to a higher level of risk, including unsystematic risk and liquidity risk. Approaches that can be used to mitigate the risks of a concentrated position include sell and diversify; staged diversification; hedging and monetization strategies; tax-free exchanges; tax-deferral strategies; and estate and tax planning strategies, such as charitable trusts, private foundations, and donor-advised funds., A completion portfolio is an index-based portfolio that when added to the concentrated position, creates an overall portfolio with exposures similar to the investor’s benchmark., Equity monetization refers to a group of strategies that allows an investor to receive cash for a stock position without an outright sale. The investor can hedge a part of the position using a short sale, a total return swap, options, futures, or a forward sale contract and then borrow against the hedged position. The loan proceeds are then invested in a diversified portfolio of other investments., Donating the appreciated asset to a charitable remainder trust allows the shares to be sold without incurring a capital gains tax. The trust can then build a diversified portfolio to provide income for the life of the beneficiaries., Strategies to free up capital concentrated in a privately-owned business or real estate include a personal line of credit secured by company shares, leveraged recapitalization, an employee stock ownership plan, mortgage financing, and a charitable trust or donor-advised fund., Estate planning is the process of preparing for the disposition of one’s estate upon death and during one’s lifetime. Objectives of gift and estate planning include maintaining sufficient income and liquidity, achieving the clients’ goals with respect to control over the assets, protection of the assets from creditors, minimization of tax liability, preservation of family wealth, business succession, and achieving charitable goals., An estate tax is the tax on the aggregate value of a deceased person’s assets. It is paid out of the estate. An inheritance tax is paid by each individual beneficiary. A gift tax is paid on a transfer of money or property to another person without receiving at least equal value in return. Many jurisdictions have tax-free allowances that can be used for transferring assets under a certain threshold without paying an estate or inheritance tax., A will outlines the rights others will have over one’s property after death. Probate is the legal process to confirm the validity of the will., Common law jurisdictions give owners the right to use their own judgment regarding the rights others will have over their property after death. Many civil law countries place restrictions on the disposition of an estate, typically giving certain relatives some minimum share of the assets., Common estate planning tools include trusts, foundations, life insurance, and companies. A trust is a legal relationship in which the trustee holds and manages the assets for the benefit of the beneficiaries. A trust can be either revocable or irrevocable. An irrevocable trust generally provides greater asset protection from creditors. A foundation is typically established to hold assets for a specific charitable purpose. The founder can exercise some control in the administration and decision making of the foundation., Life insurance and other forms of insurance can be used to accomplish estate planning objectives., Companies—specifically, a controlled foreign corporation—may allow the owner to defer taxes on income until the earnings are distributed to shareholders or until the company is sold or shares otherwise disposed., Family governance is a process for a family’s collective communication and decision making designed to serve current and future generations. Good family governance establishes principles for collaboration among family members, preserving and growing family’s wealth, and increasing human and financial capital across the generations. A sound family governance system may mitigate many of the behavioral biases that impede effective decision making., Conflict resolution can be particularly challenging in a family context. A family constitution can help wealthy families anticipate possible conflicts and agree on a common set of rights, values, and responsibilities., Managing a concentrated position arising from a family business is more than just an investment issue. The private wealth adviser should be prepared to work with the client in succession planning and post-sale considerations, such as the loss of a key activity that united family members., Effective estate planning requires planning for the unexpected, including divorce and incapacity.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level3/RR_2024_L3V4R4_topics_in_private_wealth_management.pdf,

Human capital is the net present value of the individual’s future expected labor income, whereas financial capital consists of assets currently owned by the individual and can include such items as a bank account, individual securities, pooled funds, a retirement account, and a home., Economic net worth is an extension of traditional balance sheet net worth that includes claims to future assets that can be used for consumption, such as human capital, as well as the present value of pension benefits., There are typically four key steps in the risk management process for individuals: Specify the objective, identify risks, evaluate risks and select appropriate methods to manage the risks, and monitor outcomes and risk exposures and make appropriate adjustments in methods., The financial stages of life for adults can be categorized in the following seven periods: education phase, early career, career development, peak accumulation, pre-retirement, early retirement, and late retirement., The primary goal of an economic (holistic) balance sheet is to arrive at an accurate depiction of an individual’s overall financial health by accounting for the present value of all available marketable and non-marketable assets, as well as all liabilities. An economic (holistic) balance sheet includes traditional assets and liabilities, as well as human capital and pension value, as assets and includes consumption and bequests as liabilities., The total economic wealth of an individual changes throughout his or her lifetime, as do the underlying assets that make up that wealth. The total economic wealth of younger individuals is typically dominated by the value of their human capital. As individuals age, earnings will accumulate, increasing financial capital., Earnings risk refers to the risks associated with the earnings potential of an individual—that is, events that could negatively affect someone’s human and financial capital., Premature death risk relates to the death of an individual, such as a family member, whose future earnings (human capital) were expected to help pay for the financial needs and aspirations of the family., Longevity risk is the risk of reaching an age at which one’s income and financial assets are insufficient to provide adequate support., Property risk relates to the possibility that one’s property may be damaged, destroyed, stolen, or lost. There are different types of property insurance, depending on the asset, such as automobile insurance and homeowner’s insurance., Liability risk refers to the possibility that an individual or other entity may be held legally liable for the financial costs of property damage or physical injury., Health risk refers to the risks and implications associated with illness or injury. Health risks manifest themselves in different ways over the life cycle and can have significant implications for human capital., The primary purpose of life insurance is to help replace the economic value of an individual to a family or a business in the event of that individual’s death. The family’s need for life insurance is related to the potential loss associated with the future earnings power of that individual., The two main types of life insurance are temporary and permanent. Temporary life insurance, or term life insurance, provides insurance for a certain period of time specified at purchase, whereas permanent insurance, or whole life insurance, is used to provide lifetime coverage, assuming the premiums are paid over the entire period., Fixed annuities provide a benefit that is fixed (or known) for life, whereas variable annuities have a benefit that can change over time and that is generally based on the performance of some underlying portfolio or investment. When selecting between fixed and variable annuities, there are a number of important considerations, such as the volatility of the benefit, flexibility, future market expectations, fees, and inflation concerns., Among the factors that would likely increase demand for an annuity are the following: longer-than-average life expectancy, greater preference for lifetime income, less concern for leaving money to heirs, more conservative investing preferences, and lower guaranteed income from other sources (such as pensions)., Techniques for managing a risk include risk avoidance, risk reduction, risk transfer, and risk retention. The most appropriate choice among these techniques often is related to consideration of the frequency and severity of losses associated with the risk., The decision to retain risk or buy insurance is determined by a household’s risk tolerance. At the same level of wealth, a more risk-tolerant household will prefer to retain more risk, either through higher insurance deductibles or by simply not buying insurance, than will a less risk-tolerant household. Insurance products that have a higher load will encourage a household to retain more risk., An individual’s total economic wealth affects portfolio construction through asset allocation, which includes the overall allocation to risky assets, as well as the underlying asset classes, such as stocks and bonds, selected by the individual., Investment risk, property risk, and human capital risk can be either idiosyncratic or systematic. Examples of idiosyncratic risks include the risks of a specific occupation, the risk of living a very long life or experiencing a long-term illness, and the risk of premature death or loss of property. Systematic risks affect all households.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level3/RR_2024_L3V4R5_risk_management_for_individuals.pdf,

Those steps are followed by asset allocation, security analysis, portfolio construction, portfolio monitoring and rebalancing, and performance measurement and reporting., Types of investors include individual and institutional investors. Institutional investors include defined benefit pension plans, endowments and foundations, banks, insurance companies, and sovereign wealth funds., The asset management industry is an integral component of the global financial services sector. Asset managers offer either active management, passive management, or both. Asset managers are typically categorized as traditional or alternative, although the line between traditional and alternative has blurred., Three key trends in the asset management industry include the growth of passive investing, “big data” in the investment process, and robo-advisers in the wealth management industry., Investors use different types of investment products in their portfolios. These include mutual funds, separately managed accounts, exchange-traded funds, hedge funds, and private equity and venture capital funds.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level1a/RR_2024_L1V6R1_portfolio_management_overview.pdf,

Managers following a longer-term strategy will trade with less urgency if alpha decay is expected to be slower., Trading is required to keep portfolios at targeted risk levels or risk exposures, to hedge risks that may be outside a portfolio manager’s investment objectives or that the portfolio manager does not have an investment view on., Trading may be liquidity driven resulting from client activity or index reconstitutions. In these cases, managers typically trade using end-of-day closing prices because these prices are used for fund and benchmark valuation., Inputs affecting trade strategy selection include the following types: order related, security related, market related, and user based., Order characteristics include the side (or trade direction) and size of an order. Percentage of average daily volume is a standardized measure used in trading that indicates what order size can realistically be traded. Large trades are generally traded over longer time horizons to minimize market impact., Security characteristics include security type, short-term (trade) alpha, security price volatility, and a security’s liquidity profile., Market conditions at the time of trading (intraday trading volumes, bid–ask spreads, and security and market volatility) should be incorporated into trade strategy since they can differ from anticipated conditions., Market volatility and liquidity vary over time, and liquidity considerations may differ substantially during periods of crisis., Individuals with higher levels of risk aversion are more concerned with market risk and tend to trade with greater urgency., Market impact is the adverse price impact in a security caused from trading an order and can represent one of the largest costs in trading., Execution risk is the adverse price impact resulting from a change in the fundamental value of the security and is often proxied by price volatility., Reference price benchmarks inform order trading prices and include pre-trade, intraday, post-trade, and price target benchmarks., Managers seeking short-term alpha will use pre-trade benchmarks, such as the arrival price, when they wish to transact close to current market prices (greater trade urgency)., Managers without views on short-term price movements who wish to participate in volumes over the execution horizon typically use an intraday benchmark, such as VWAP or TWAP., Managers of index funds or funds whose valuation is calculated using closing prices typically select the closing price post-trade benchmark to minimize fund risk and tracking error., The primary goal of a trading strategy is to balance the expected costs, risks, and alpha associated with trading the order in a manner consistent with the portfolio manager’s trading objectives, risk aversion, and other known constraints., Execution algorithms can be classified into the following types: scheduled, liquidity seeking, arrival price, dark aggregators, and smart order routers., Equities are traded on exchanges and other multilateral trading venues. Algorithmic trading is common, and most trades are electronic, except for very large trades and trades in illiquid securities., Fixed-income securities are generally traded not on exchanges but in a bilateral, dealer-centric market structure where dealers make markets in the securities. The majority of fixed-income securities are relatively illiquid, especially if they have been issued in prior periods, so-called off-the-run bonds., Most of the trading volume in exchange-traded derivatives is concentrated in futures. Electronic trading is pervasive, and algorithmic trading is growing., OTC derivative markets have historically been opaque, with little public data about prices, trade sizes, and structure details. In recent years, regulators have been placing pressure on OTC markets to introduce central clearing facilities and to display trades publicly in an attempt to increase contract standardization and price discovery and reduce counterparty risk., There is no exchange or centralized clearing place for the majority of spot currency trades. Spot currency markets consist of a number of electronic venues and broker markets. The currency market is entirely an OTC market., The implementation shortfall measure is the standard for measuring the total cost of the trade. IS compares a portfolio’s actual return with its paper return (where transactions are based on decision price)., The IS attribution decomposes total trade cost into its delay, execution, and opportunity cost components., Delay cost is the cost associated with not submitting the order to the market at the time of the portfolio manager’s investment decision., Execution cost is the cost due to the buying and/or selling pressure of the portfolio manager and corresponding market risk., Opportunity cost is the cost due to not being able to execute all shares of the order because of adverse price movement or insufficient liquidity., Trade evaluation measures the execution quality of the trade and the performance of the trader, broker, and/or algorithm used., Various techniques measure trade cost execution using different benchmarks (pre-trade, intraday, and post-trade)., Trade cost analysis enables investors to better manage trading costs and understand where trading activities can be improved through the use of appropriate trading partners and venues., Major regulators mandate that asset managers have in place a trade policy document that clearly and comprehensively articulates a firm’s trading policies and escalation procedures., The objective of a trade policy is to ensure the asset manager’s execution and order-handling procedures are in line with their fiduciary duty owed to clients for best execution., A trade policy document needs to incorporate the following key aspects: meaning of best execution, factors determining the optimal order execution approach, handling trading errors, listing of eligible brokers and execution venues, and a process to monitor execution arrangements.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level3/RR_2024_L3V5R2_trade_strategy_and_execution.pdf,

describe limitations of appraisal measures and related metrics; evaluate the skill of an investment manager.","Performance measurement provides an overall indication of the portfolio’s performance., Performance attribution builds on performance measurement to explain how the performance was achieved., Performance appraisal leverages both returns and attribution to infer the quality of the investment process., An effective attribution process must reconcile to the total portfolio return/risk, reflect the investment decision-making process, quantify the active portfolio management decisions, and provide a complete understanding of the excess return/risk of the portfolio., Return attribution analyzes the impact of investment decisions on the returns, whereas risk attribution analyzes the risk consequences of the investment decisions., Macro attribution considers the decisions of the fund sponsor, whereas micro attribution considers the decisions of the individual portfolio manager., Returns-based attribution uses returns to identify the factors that have generated those returns., Holdings-based attribution uses the holdings over time to evaluate the decisions that contributed to the returns., Transactions-based attribution uses both holdings and transactions to fully explain the performance over the evaluation period., There are various techniques for interpreting the sources of portfolio returns using a specified attribution approach., Fixed-income attribution considers the unique factors that drive bond returns, including interest rate risk and default risk., When selecting a risk attribution approach, practitioners should consider the investment decision-making process and the type of attribution analysis., Attribution is used to calculate and interpret the contribution to portfolio return and volatility from the asset allocation and within-asset-class active/passive decisions., Liability-based benchmarks focus on the cash flows that the assets are required to generate., Asset-based benchmarks contain a collection of assets to compare against the portfolio’s assets., Valid benchmarks should be unambiguous, investable, measurable, appropriate, reflective of current investment opinions, specified in advance, and accountable., Benchmark misspecification creates subsequent incorrect performance measurement and invalidates the attribution and appraisal analyses., Alternative investments are difficult to benchmark because they are typically less liquid, have fewer available market benchmarks, and often lack transparency., Investment performance appraisal ratios—including the Sortino ratio, upside/downside capture ratios, maximum drawdown, and drawdown duration—measure investment skill., Appraisal ratios must be used with care, noting the assumptions of each ratio and affording the appropriateness to the measured investment process, risk tolerance, and investor time horizon., Although appraisal ratios help identify manager skill (as opposed to luck), they often are based on investment return data, which are often limited and subject to error., Evaluation of investment manager skill requires the use of a broad range of analysis tools, with fundamental understanding of how the tools work, how they complement each other, and their specific limitations.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level3/RR_2024_L3V5R3_portfolio_performance_evaluation.pdf,
Exchange Traded Funds: Mechanics and Applications,2024 Curriculum,CFA Program Level II,Portfolio Management and Wealth Planning,The member should be able to: explain the creation/redemption process of ETFs and the function of authorized participants;<list-type>los</list-type> describe how ETFs are traded in secondary markets; describe sources of tracking error for ETFs; describe factors affecting ETF bid–ask spreads; describe sources of ETF premiums and discounts to NAV; describe costs of owning an ETF; describe types of ETF risk; identify and describe portfolio uses of ETFs.,The member should be able to: explain the creation/redemption process of ETFs and the function of authorized participants;<list-type>los</list-type> describe how ETFs are traded in secondary markets; describe sources of tracking error for ETFs; describe factors affecting ETF bid–ask spreads; describe sources of ETF premiums and discounts to NAV; describe costs of owning an ETF; describe types of ETF risk; identify and describe portfolio uses of ETFs.,"ETFs rely on a creation/redemption mechanism that allows for the continuous creation and redemption of ETF shares., The only investors who can create or redeem new ETF shares are a special group of institutional investors called authorized participants., ETFs trade on both the primary market (directly between APs and issuers) and on the secondary markets (exchange-based or OTC trades, such as listed equity)., End investors trade ETFs on the secondary markets, like stocks., Holding period performance deviations (tracking differences) are more useful than the standard deviation of daily return differences (tracking error)., ETF tracking differences from the index occur for the following reasons: fees and expenses, representative sampling/optimization, use of depositary receipts and other ETFs, index changes, fund accounting practices, regulatory and tax requirements, and asset manager operations., ETFs are generally taxed in the same manner as the securities they hold, with some nuances:, ETFs are more tax fair than traditional mutual funds, because portfolio trading is generally not required when money enters or exits an ETF., Owing to the creation/redemption process, ETFs can be more tax efficient than mutual funds., ETF issuers can redeem out low-cost-basis securities to minimize future taxable gains., Local markets have unique ETF taxation issues that should be considered., ETF bid–ask spreads vary by trade size and are usually published for smaller trade sizes. They are tightest for ETFs that are very liquid and have continuous two-way order flow. For less liquid, ETFs, the following factors can determine the quoted bid–ask spread of an ETF trade: Creation/redemption costs, brokerage and exchange fees Bid–ask spread of underlying securities held by the ETF Risk of hedging or carry positions by liquidity provider Market makers’ target profit spread, ETF bid–ask spreads on fixed income relative to equity tend to be wider because the underlying bonds trade in dealer markets and hedging is more difficult. Spreads on ETFs holding international stocks are tightest when the underlying security markets are open for trading., ETF premiums and discounts refer to the difference between the exchange price of the ETF and the fund’s calculated NAV, based on the prices of the underlying securities and weighted by the portfolio positions at the start of each trading day. Premiums and discounts can occur because NAVs are based on the last traded prices, which may be observed at a time lag to the ETF price, or because the ETF is more liquid and more reflective of current information and supply and demand than the underlying securities in rapidly changing markets., Costs of ETF ownership may be positive or negative and include both explicit and implicit costs. The main components of ETF cost are the fund management fee; tracking error; portfolio turnover; trading costs, such as commissions, bid–ask spreads, and premiums/discounts; taxable gains/losses; and security lending., Trading costs are incurred when the position is entered and exited. These one-time costs decrease as a portion of total holding costs over longer holding periods and are a more significant consideration for shorter-term tactical ETF traders., Other costs, such as management fees and portfolio turnover, increase as a proportion of overall cost as the investor holding period lengthens. These costs are a more significant consideration for longer-term buy-and-hold investors., ETFs are different from exchange-traded notes, although both use the creation/redemption process. Exchange-traded notes carry unique counterparty risks of default. Swap-based ETFs may carry counterparty risk. ETFs, like mutual funds, may lend their securities, creating risk of counterparty default. ETF closures can create unexpected tax liabilities., ETFs are used for core asset class exposure, multi-asset, dynamic, and tactical strategies based on investment views or changing market conditions; for factor or smart beta strategies with a goal to improve return or modify portfolio risk; and for portfolio efficiency applications, such as rebalancing, liquidity management, completion strategies, and transitions., ETFs are useful for investing cash inflows, as well as for raising proceeds to provide for client withdrawals. ETFs are used for rebalancing to target asset class weights and for “completion strategies” to fill a temporary gap in an asset class category, sector, or investment theme or when external managers are underweight. When positions are in transition from one external manager to another, ETFs are often used as the temporary holding and may be used to fund the new manager., All types of investors use ETFs to establish low-cost core exposure to asset classes, equity style benchmarks, fixed-income categories, and commodities., For more tactical investing, thematic ETFs are used in active portfolio management and represent narrow or niche areas of the equity market not well represented by industry or sector ETFs., Systematic, active strategies that use rules-based benchmarks for exposure to such factors as size, value, momentum, quality, or dividend tilts or combinations of these factors are frequently implemented with ETFs., Multi-asset and global asset allocation or macro strategies that manage positions dynamically as market conditions change are also areas where ETFs are frequently used., Proper utilization requires investors to carefully research and assess the ETF’s index construction methodology, costs, risks, and performance history.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level2/level2a/RR_2024_L2V5R7_exchange_traded_funds.pdf,

Developed markets face common macro factors, with market and credit cycle differences affecting relative interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and credit spreads. Emerging markets usually exhibit higher growth combined with greater sovereign and geopolitical risk, currency restrictions, and capital controls., Structured financial instruments offer active credit managers access to liquid bond portfolios, fixed-income cash flows derived from real estate and consumer loans, and enhanced returns by adding volatility and/or debt exposure via tranching across the credit spectrum., Key considerations for fixed-income analytical tools include the accuracy of model inputs and assumptions as well as alignment between model outputs and fixed-income manager objectives.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level3/RR_2024_L3V3R2_fixed_income_active_management_credit.pdf,

The effective spread is two times the difference between the trade price and the midquote price before the trade occurred. The effective spread is a poor estimate of actual transaction costs when large orders have been filled in many parts over time or when small orders receive price improvement., Transaction costs include explicit costs and implicit costs. Explicit costs are the direct costs of trading. They include broker commissions, transaction taxes, stamp duties, and exchange fees. Implicit costs include indirect costs, such as the impact of the trade on the price received. The bid–ask spread, market impact, delay, and unfilled trades all contribute to implicit trading costs., The implementation shortfall method measures the total cost of implementing an investment decision by capturing all explicit and implicit trading costs. It includes the market impact costs, delay costs, as well as opportunity costs., The VWAP method of estimating transaction costs compares average fill prices to average market prices during a period surrounding the trade. It tends to produce lower transaction cost estimates than does implementation shortfall because it often does not measure the market impact of an order well., Markets have become increasingly fragmented as venues trading the same instruments have proliferated. Trading in any given instrument now occurs in multiple venues., The advantages of electronic trading systems include cost and operational efficiencies, lack of human bias, extraordinarily fast speed, and infinite span and scope of attention., Latency is the elapsed time between the occurrence of an event and a subsequent action that depends on that event. Traders use fast communication systems and fast computer systems to minimize latency to execute their strategies faster than others., Hidden orders, quote leapfrogging, flickering quotes, and the use of machine learning to support trading strategies commonly are found in electronic markets., Traders commonly use advanced order types, trading tactics, and algorithms in electronic markets., Electronic trading has benefited investors through greater trade process efficiencies and reduced transaction costs. At the same time, electronic trading has increased systemic risks., Examples of systemic risks posed by electronic traders include: runaway algorithms that produce streams of unintended orders caused by programming mistakes, fat finger errors that occur when a manual trader submits a larger order than intended, overlarge orders that demand more liquidity than the market can provide, and malevolent order streams created deliberately to disrupt the markets., Real-time surveillance of markets often can detect order front running and various market manipulation strategies., Market manipulators use such improper activities as trading for market impact, rumormongering, wash trading, and spoofing to further their schemes., Market manipulation strategies include bluffing, squeezing, cornering, and gunning.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2023/RR-2023-L2V6R3-trading-costs-electronic-markets.pdf,

The price of an asset and/or asset class may reflect more than one risk factor, and complicated spread positions may be necessary to identify and isolate particular risk factors. Their use as units of analysis in asset allocation is driven by considerations of controlling systematic risk exposures., The global market portfolio represents a highly diversified asset allocation that can serve as a baseline asset allocation in an asset-only approach., There are two dimensions of passive/active choices. One dimension relates to the management of the strategic asset allocation itself—for example, whether to deviate from it tactically or not. The second dimension relates to passive and active implementation choices in investing the allocation to a given asset class. Tactical and dynamic asset allocation relate to the first dimension; active and passive choices for implementing allocations to asset classes relate to the second dimension., Risk budgeting addresses the question of which types of risks to take and how much of each to take. Active risk budgeting addresses the question of how much benchmark-relative risk an investor is willing to take. At the level of the overall asset allocation, active risk can be defined relative to the strategic asset allocation benchmark. At the level of individual asset classes, active risk can be defined relative to the benchmark proxy., Rebalancing is the discipline of adjusting portfolio weights to more closely align with the strategic asset allocation. Rebalancing approaches include calendar-based and range-based rebalancing. Calendar-based rebalancing rebalances the portfolio to target weights on a periodic basis. Range-based rebalancing sets rebalancing thresholds or trigger points around target weights. The ranges may be fixed width, percentage based, or volatility based. Range-based rebalancing permits tighter control of the asset mix compared with calendar rebalancing., Strategic considerations in rebalancing include transaction costs, risk aversion, correlations among asset classes, volatility, and beliefs concerning momentum, taxation, and asset class liquidity.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level3/RR_2024_L3V1R3_asset_allocation_overview.pdf,

The charts are analyzed using various indicators in order to make investment recommendations., Technical analysis has three main principles and assumptions: (1) The market discounts everything, (2) prices move in trends and countertrends, and (3) price action is repetitive, with certain patterns reoccurring., Increasingly, analysts, fund managers, and individual investors are studying the basic principles of technical analysis to support their decision making in financial markets. Behavioral finance, which is the study of the influence of psychology on the behavior of investors, focuses on the fact that investors are not always rational, have limits to their self-control, and are influenced by their own biases. This relatively new field of finance is motivating more practitioners to consider technical analysis as a tool for understanding and explaining irrationalities in financial markets., Technical analysis can be used on any freely traded security in the global market and is used on a wide range of financial instruments, such as equities, bonds, commodities, currencies, and futures. However, in general, technical analysis is most effectively applied to liquid markets. Therefore, technical analysis has limited usefulness for illiquid securities, where a small trade can have a large impact on prices., The primary tools used in technical analysis are charts and indicators. Charts are graphical displays of price and volume data. Indicators are approaches to analyzing the charts. While the tools can be used on a standalone basis, many analysts, fund managers, and investors will find added value in combining the techniques of chart analysis with their own research and investment approach., Charts provide information about past price behavior and provide a basis for inferences about likely future price behavior. Basic charts include line charts, bar charts, and candlestick charts., Charts can be drawn either to a linear scale or to a logarithmic scale. A logarithmic scale is appropriate when the data move through a range of values representing several orders of magnitude (e.g., from 10 to 10,000), whereas a linear scale is better suited to narrower ranges (e.g., $35 to $50)., Volume is an important element of technical analysis and is often included on charts. Volume can be viewed as a confirmation in that it indicates the strength or conviction of buyers and sellers in determining a security’s price., One of the most important steps in successfully applying technical analysis is to define the time period being analyzed. Technical analysis and charting become more reliable as the time scale increases from intraday to daily, weekly, and even monthly. Analysts and investors whose primary research method is fundamental analysis will find more value in charting instruments on a weekly and/or a monthly scale. Longer time frames will allow analysts and investors to better identify the consolidation and trend periods and time their purchases or sales of securities., Several basic concepts can be applied to charts. These include relative strength analysis, trend, consolidation, support, resistance, and change in polarity., Relative strength analysis is based on the ratio of the prices of a security and a benchmark and is used to compare the performance of one asset with the performance of another asset., The concept of trend is an important aspect of technical analysis. An uptrend is defined as a sequence of higher highs and higher lows. To draw an uptrend line, a technician draws a line connecting the lows on the price chart. A downtrend is defined as a sequence of lower highs and lower lows. To draw a downtrend line, a technician draws a line connecting the highs on the price chart., Support is defined as a low price range in which the price stops declining because of buying activity. It is the opposite of resistance, which is a price range in which price stops rising because of selling activity., Chart patterns are formations appearing on price charts that create some type of recognizable shape. There are two major types of chart patterns: reversal patterns and continuation patterns., Reversal patterns signal the end of a trend. Common reversal patterns are head and shoulders (H&S), inverse H&S, double top, double bottom, triple top, and triple bottom., Continuation patterns indicate that a market trend that was in place prior to the pattern formation will continue once the pattern is completed. Common continuation patterns are triangles (symmetrical, ascending, and descending), rectangles (bullish and bearish), flags, and pennants., Technical indicators are used to derive additional information from basic chart patterns. An indicator is any measure based on price, market sentiment, or fund flows that can be used to predict changes in price. Mathematically calculated indicators usually have a supply and demand underpinning. Basic types of indicators include price-based indicators, momentum oscillators, and sentiment indicators., Price-based indicators incorporate information contained in market prices. Common price-based indicators include the moving average and Bollinger Bands., The moving average is the average of the closing prices of a security over a specified number of periods. Moving averages are a smoothing technique that gives the technical analyst a view of market trends. So, a moving average can be viewed as a trend filter. Long-term moving averages can provide important signals. A price move above the long-term moving average is a sign of an uptrend. A price move below the long-term moving average is a sign of a downtrend., When a short-term moving average crosses over a longer-term moving average from underneath, this movement is considered a bullish indicator and is called a “bullish crossover.” When a short-term moving-average crosses over a longer-term moving average from above, this movement is a bearish indicator and is called a “bearish crossover.”, Bollinger Bands combine the concept of a moving average with standard deviations around the moving average. This tool is useful in defining a trading range for the security being analyzed. The Bollinger Band width indicator provides an indication of volatility. The idea is that periods of low volatility are followed by periods of high volatility, so that relatively narrow band width can foreshadow an advance or decline in the security under analysis., Momentum oscillators are constructed from price data, but they are calculated so that they fluctuate between a low and a high, typically between 0 and 100. Some examples of momentum oscillators include rate of change (ROC) oscillators, the relative strength index (RSI), stochastic oscillators, and the MACD (moving-average convergence/divergence oscillator)., Momentum oscillators can be viewed as graphical representations of market sentiment that show when selling or buying activity is more aggressive than usual. Technical analysts also look for convergence or divergence between oscillators and price. For example, when the price reaches a new high, this outcome is usually considered “bullish.” But if the momentum oscillator does not also reach a new high, this scenario is considered divergence and an early warning sign of weakness., Momentum oscillators also alert the technical analyst to overbought or oversold conditions. For example, in an oversold condition, market sentiment is considered unsustainably bearish., Sentiment indicators attempt to gauge investor activity for signs of increasing bullishness or bearishness. Commonly used calculated statistical indexes are the put/call ratio, the VIX, and margin debt., Intermarket analysis combines technical analysis of the major categories of securities—namely, equities, bonds, currencies, and commodities—to identify market trends and possible inflections in trends. Intermarket analysis also looks at industry subsectors and their relationship to sectors and industries. In addition, it measures the relative performance of major equity benchmarks around the globe., Technical analysis can use either a top-down approach or a bottom-up approach to analyze securities. The top-down method is useful for identifying outperforming asset classes, countries, or sectors. This approach can add value to asset allocation decisions. Allocation shifts can occur within an asset class or across asset classes. The bottom-up method is useful for identifying individual stocks, commodities, or currencies that are outperforming, irrespective of market, industry, or macro trends., The technical analyst can add value to an investment team by providing trading/ investment ideas through either top-down or bottom-up analysis, depending on the nature of the investment firm or fund. In addition, technical analysis can add value to a fundamental portfolio approach by providing input on the timing of the purchase or sale of a security.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2023/RR-2023-L1V6R4-technical-analysis.pdf,

Risk management is not only about avoiding risk., Taking risk is an active choice by boards and management, investment managers, and individuals. Risks must be understood and carefully chosen and managed., Risk exposure is the extent to which an organization’s value may be affected through sensitivity to underlying risks., Risk management is a process that defines risk tolerance and measures, monitors, and modifies risks to be in line with that tolerance., A risk management framework is the infrastructure, processes, and analytics needed to support effective risk management; it includes risk governance, risk identification and measurement, risk infrastructure, risk policies and processes, risk mitigation and management, communication, and strategic risk analysis and integration., Risk governance is the top-level foundation for risk management, including risk oversight and setting risk tolerance for the organization., Risk identification and measurement is the quantitative and qualitative assessment of all potential sources of risk and the organization’s risk exposures., Risk infrastructure comprises the resources and systems required to track and assess the organization’s risk profile., Risk policies and processes are management’s complement to risk governance at the operating level., Risk mitigation and management is the active monitoring and adjusting of risk exposures, integrating all the other factors of the risk management framework., Communication includes risk reporting and active feedback loops so that the risk process improves decision making., Strategic risk analysis and integration involves using these risk tools to rigorously sort out the factors that are and are not adding value as well as incorporating this analysis into the management decision process, with the intent of improving outcomes., Employing a risk management committee, along with a chief risk officer (CRO), are hallmarks of a strong risk governance framework., Governance and the entire risk process should take an enterprise risk management perspective to ensure that the value of the entire enterprise is maximized., Risk tolerance, a key element of good risk governance, delineates which risks are acceptable, which are unacceptable, and how much risk the overall organization can be exposed to., Risk budgeting is any means of allocating investments or assets by their risk characteristics., Financial risks are those that arise from activity in the financial markets., Non-financial risks arise from actions within an organization or from external origins, such as the environment, the community, regulators, politicians, suppliers, and customers., Financial risks consist of market risk, credit risk, and liquidity risk., Market risk arises from movements in stock prices, interest rates, exchange rates, and commodity prices., Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not pay an amount owed., Liquidity risk is the risk that, as a result of degradation in market conditions or the lack of market participants, one will be unable to sell an asset without lowering the price to less than the fundamental value., Non-financial risks consist of a variety of risks, including settlement risk, legal risk, regulatory risk, accounting risk, tax risk, model risk, tail risk, and operational risk., Operational risk is the risk that arises either from within the operations of an organization or from external events that are beyond the control of the organization but affect its operations. Operational risk can be caused by employees, the weather and natural disasters, vulnerabilities of IT systems, or terrorism., Solvency risk is the risk that the organization does not survive or succeed because it runs out of cash to meet its financial obligations., Individuals face many of the same organizational risks outlined here but also face health risk, mortality or longevity risk, and property and casualty risk., Risks are not necessarily independent because many risks arise as a result of other risks; risk interactions can be extremely non-linear and harmful., Risk drivers are the fundamental global and domestic macroeconomic and industry factors that create risk., Common measures of risk include standard deviation or volatility; asset-specific measures, such as beta or duration; derivative measures, such as delta, gamma, vega, and rho; and tail measures such as value at risk, CVaR and expected loss given default., Risk can be modified by prevention and avoidance, risk transfer (insurance), or risk shifting (derivatives)., Risk can be mitigated internally through self-insurance or diversification., The primary determinants of which method is best for modifying risk are the benefits weighed against the costs, with consideration for the overall final risk profile and adherence to risk governance objectives.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level1a/RR_2024_L1V6R4_intro_risk_management.pdf,

Each return computation has special applications for evaluating investments., Risk-averse investors make investment decisions based on the risk–return trade-off, maximizing return for the same risk, and minimizing risk for the same return. They may be concerned, however, by deviations from a normal return distribution and from assumptions of financial markets’ operational efficiency., Investors are risk averse, and historical data confirm that financial markets price assets for risk-averse investors., The risk of a two-asset portfolio is dependent on the proportions of each asset, their standard deviations and the correlation (or covariance) between the assets’ returns. As the number of assets in a portfolio increases, the correlation among asset risks becomes a more important determinate of portfolio risk., Combining assets with low correlations reduces portfolio risk., The two-fund separation theorem allows us to separate decision making into two steps. In the first step, the optimal risky portfolio and the capital allocation line are identified, which are the same for all investors. In the second step, investor risk preferences enable us to find a unique optimal investor portfolio for each investor., The addition of a risk-free asset creates portfolios that are dominant to portfolios of risky assets in all cases except for the optimal risky portfolio.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level1a/RR_2024_L1V2R1_portfolio_risk_return_part_I.pdf,

The timing and magnitude of these expected cash flows will thus be an integral part of the security’s market value, as will the discount rate applied to these expected cash flows, which is the sum of a real default-free interest rate, expected inflation, and possibly several risk premiums. Each of these elements will be influenced by the business cycle. It is through these components that the real economy exerts its influence on the market value of financial instruments., The average level of real short-term interest rates is positively related to the trend rate of growth of the underlying economy and also to the volatility of economic growth in the economy. Other things being equal, these relationships mean that we should expect to find that the average level of real short-term interest rates is higher in an economy with high and volatile growth and lower in an economy with lower, more stable growth., On average, over time, according to the Taylor rule, a central bank’s policy rate should comprise the sum of an economy’s trend growth plus inflation expectations, which might, in turn, be anchored to an explicit inflation target. This policy rate level is referred to as the neutral rate. Other things being equal, when inflation is above (below) the targeted level, the policy rate should be above (below) the neutral rate, and when the output gap is positive (negative), the policy rate should also be above (below) the neutral rate. The policy rate can thus vary over time with inflation expectations and the economy’s output gap., Short-term nominal rates will be closely related to a central bank’s policy rate of interest and will comprise the real interest rate that is required to balance the requirements of savers and investors plus investors’ expectations of inflation over the relevant borrowing or lending period. Short-term nominal interest rates will be positively related to short-term real interest rates and to inflation expectations., If bond investors were risk neutral, then the term structure of interest rates would be determined by short-term interest rate expectations. But bond investors are risk averse, which means that they will normally demand a risk premium for investing in even default-free government bonds. This risk premium will generally rise with the maturity of these bonds because longer-dated government bonds tend to be less negatively correlated with consumption and, therefore, represent a less useful consumption hedge for investors. Overall, the shape of the curve will be determined by a combination of short-term interest rates and inflation expectations as well as risk premiums. In turn, these factors will be influenced by the business cycle and policymakers., The yield differential between default-free conventional government bonds and index-linked equivalents will be driven by inflation expectations and a risk premium. The risk premium will be largely influenced by investors’ uncertainty about future inflation., The difference between the yield on a corporate bond and that on a government bond with the same currency denomination and maturity is referred to as the measured credit spread. It is conceptually akin (but not equal) to the risk premium demanded by investors in compensation for the additional credit risk that they bear compared with that embodied in the default-free government bond. It tends to rise in times of economic weakness, as the probability of default rises, and tends to narrow in times of robust economic growth, when defaults are less common., The uncertainty about and time variation in future equity cash flows (dividends) is a distinct feature of equity investment, as opposed to corporate bond investment. This feature explains why we would expect the equity premium to be larger than the credit premium. In times of economic weakness or stress, the uncertainty about future dividends will tend to be higher, and we should thus expect the equity risk premium to rise in such an economic environment., Given the uncertain nature of the cash flows generated by equities, investors will demand an equity risk premium because the consumption hedging properties of equities are poor. In other words, equities tend not to pay off in bad times. Because in the event of company failure an equity holder will lose all of his or her investment whereas an investor in the company’s bonds may recover a significant portion of his or her investment, it would be reasonable to assume that a risk-averse investor would demand a higher premium on an equity holding than on a corporate bond holding. The two premiums will tend to be positively correlated over time and will tend to be influenced by the business cycle in similar ways., The P/E tends to rise during periods of economic expansion and to fall during recessions. A “high” P/E could be the result of a number of factors, including the following: falling real interest rates, a decline in the equity risk premium, an increase in the expectation of future real earnings growth, an expectation of lower operating and/or financial risk, or a combination of all of these factors. All of these components will be influenced by the business cycle., The market value of an investment in commercial property can be derived in much the same way as the market value of an investment in equity. The cash flows come in the form of rent, which can be enhanced with additional redevelopment values as leases on properties expire. These cash flows are uncertain, and the uncertainty surrounding them will tend to rise when the economy turns down. We might thus expect the risk premium demanded on commercial property investments to rise in these times., The pro-cyclical nature of commercial property prices means that investors will generally demand a relatively high risk premium in return for investing in this asset class. The reason is that commercial property is not a very good hedge against bad economic outcomes. In addition, the illiquid nature of property investment means that investors may also demand a liquidity premium for investing in this asset class.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level2/level2a/RR_2024_L2V6R1_economics_and_investment_markets.pdf,

Both rates are applied to the swap’s notional value to determine the size of the payments, which are typically netted. Interest rate swaps enable a party with a fixed (floating) risk or obligation to effectively convert it into a floating (fixed) one., Investors can use short-dated interest rate futures and forward rate agreements or longer-dated fixed-income (bond) futures contracts to modify their portfolios’ interest rate risk exposure., When hedging interest rate risk with bond futures, one must determine the basis point value of the portfolio to be hedged, the target basis point value, and the basis point value of the futures, which itself is determined by the basis point value of the cheapest-to-deliver bond and its conversion factor. The number of bond futures to buy or sell to reach the target basis point value is then determined by the basis point value hedge ratio: B P V H R = ( B P V T − B P V P B P V C T D ) × C F ., Cross-currency basis swaps help parties in the swap to hedge against the risk of exchange rate fluctuations and to achieve better rate outcomes. Firms that need foreign-denominated cash can obtain funding in their local currency (likely at a more favorable rate) and then swap the local currency for the required foreign currency using a cross-currency basis swap., Equity risk in a portfolio can be managed using equity swaps and total return swaps. There are three main types of equity swap: (1) receive-equity return, pay-fixed; (2) receive-equity return, pay-floating; and (3) receive-equity return, pay-another equity return. A total return swap is a modified equity swap; it also includes in the performance any dividends paid by the underlying stocks or index during the period until the swap maturity., Equity risk in a portfolio can also be managed using equity futures and forwards. Equity futures are standardized, exchange-listed contracts, and when the underlying is a stock index, only cash settlement is available at contract expiration. The number of equity futures contracts to buy or sell is determined by N f = ( β T − β S β f ) ( S F ) ., Cash equitization is a strategy designed to boost returns by finding ways to “equitize” unintended cash holdings. It is typically done using stock index futures and interest rate futures., Derivatives on volatility include VIX futures and options and variance swaps. Importantly, VIX option prices are determined from VIX futures, and both instruments allow an investor to implement a view depending on her expectations about the timing and magnitude of a change in implied volatility., In a variance swap, the buyer of the contract will pay the difference between the fixed variance strike specified in the contract and the realized variance (annualized) on the underlying over the period specified and applied to a variance notional. Thus, variance swaps allow directional bets on implied versus realized volatility., Derivatives can be used to infer market participants’ current expectations for changes over the short term in inflation (e.g., CPI swaps) and market volatility (e.g., VIX futures). Another common application is using fed funds futures prices to derive the probability of a central bank move in the federal funds rate target at the FOMC’s next meeting.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level3/RR_2024_L3V2R2_swaps_forwards_futures_strategies.pdf,

Portfolio managers often consider the following investment objectives and constraints when deciding to include equities (or asset classes in general, for that matter) in a client’s portfolio: risk objective; return objective; liquidity requirement; time horizon; tax concerns; legal and regulatory factors; and unique circumstances., Investors often segment the equity universe according to (1) size and style; (2) geography; and (3) economic activity., Sources of equity portfolio income include dividends; securities lending fees and interest; dividend capture; covered calls; and cash-covered puts (or cash-secured puts)., Sources of equity portfolio costs include management fees; performance fees; administration fees; marketing/distribution fees; and trading costs., Shareholder engagement is the process whereby companies engage with their shareholders. The process typically includes voting on corporate matters at general meetings and other forms of communication, such as quarterly investor calls or in-person meetings., Shareholder engagement can provide benefits for both shareholders and companies. From a company’s perspective, shareholder engagement can assist in developing a more effective corporate governance culture. In turn, shareholder engagement may lead to better company performance to the benefit of shareholders (as well as other stakeholders)., Disadvantages of shareholder engagement include costs and time involved, pressure on a company to meet near-term share price or earnings targets, possible selective disclosure of information, and potential conflicts of interest., Activist investors (or activists) specialize in taking stakes in companies and creating change to generate a gain on the investment., The participation of shareholders in general meetings, also known as general assemblies, and the exercise of their voting rights are among the most influential tools available for shareholder engagement., The choice of using active management or passive management is not an “either/or” (binary) alternative but rather a decision involving a passive–active spectrum. Investors may decide to position their portfolios across the passive–active spectrum based on their confidence to outperform, client preference, suitable benchmarks, client-specific mandates, risks/costs of active management, and taxes.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level3/RR_2024_L3V3R3_equity_portfolio_management.pdf,

The put provides protection or insurance against a price decline., The continuous purchase of protective puts maintains the upside potential of the portfolio, while limiting downside volatility. The cost of the puts must be carefully considered, however, because this activity may be expensive. Conversely, the occasional purchase of a protective put to deal with a bearish short-term outlook can be a reasonable risk-reducing strategy., The maximum loss with a protective put is limited because the downside risk is transferred to the option writer in exchange for the payment of the option premium., With an option spread, an investor buys one option and writes another of the same type. This approach reduces the position cost but caps the maximum payoff., A bull spread expresses a bullish view on the underlying and is normally constructed by buying a call option and writing another call option with a higher exercise price (both options have same underlying and same expiry)., A bear spread expresses a bearish view on the underlying and is normally constructed by buying a put option and writing another put option with a lower exercise price (both options have same underlying and same expiry)., With either a bull spread or a bear spread, both the maximum gain and the maximum loss are known and limited., A long (short) straddle is an option combination in which the investor buys (sells) puts and calls with the same exercise price and expiration date. The long (short) straddle investor expects increased (stable/decreased) volatility and typically requires a large (small/no) price movement in the underlying asset in order to make a profit., A collar is an option position in which the investor is long shares of stock and simultaneously writes a call with an exercise price above the current stock price and buys a put with an exercise price below the current stock price. A collar limits the range of investment outcomes by sacrificing upside gain in exchange for providing downside protection., A long (short) calendar spread involves buying (selling) a long-dated option and writing (buying) a shorter-dated option of the same type with the same exercise price. A long (short) calendar spread is used when the investment outlook is flat (volatile) in the near term but greater (lesser) return movements are expected in the future., Implied volatility is the expected volatility an underlying asset’s return and is derived from an option pricing model (i.e., the Black–Scholes–Merton model) as the value that equates the model price of an option to its market price., When implied volatilities of OTM options exceed those of ATM options, the implied volatility curve is a volatility smile. The more common shape is a volatility skew, in which implied volatility increases for OTM puts and decreases for OTM calls, as the strike price moves away from the current price., The implied volatility surface is a 3-D plot, for put and call options on the same underlying, showing expiration time (x-axis), strike prices (y-axis), and implied volatilities (z-axis). It simultaneously displays volatility skew and the term structure of implied volatility., Options, like all derivatives, should always be used in connection with a well-defined investment objective. When using options strategies, it is important to have a view on the expected change in implied volatility and the direction of movement of the underlying asset.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level3/RR_2024_L3V2R1_options_strategies.pdf,

Both spot and forward rates are quoted in terms of a bid–offer price. Forward rates are quoted in terms of the spot rate plus forward points., An FX swap is a simultaneous spot and forward transaction; one leg of the swap is buying the base currency and the other is selling it. FX swaps are used to renew outstanding forward contracts once they mature, to “roll them forward.”, The domestic-currency return on foreign-currency assets can be broken into the foreign-currency asset return and the return on the foreign currency (the percentage appreciation or depreciation of the foreign currency against the domestic currency). These two components of the domestic-currency return are multiplicative., When there are several foreign-currency assets, the portfolio domestic-currency return is the weighted average of the individual domestic-currency returns (i.e., using the portfolio weights, which should sum to one), The risk of domestic-currency returns (its standard deviation) can be approximated by using a variance formula that recognizes the individual variances and covariances (correlations) among the foreign-currency asset returns and exchange rate movements., The calculation of the domestic-currency risk involves a large number of variables that must be estimated: the risks and correlations between all of the foreign-currency asset returns and their exchange rate risks., Guidance on where to target the portfolio along the risk spectrum is part of the IPS, which makes this a strategic decision based on the investment goals and constraints of the beneficial owners of the portfolio., If the IPS allows currency risk in the portfolio, the amount of desired currency exposure will depend on both portfolio diversification considerations and cost considerations. Views on the diversifying effects of foreign-currency exposures depend on the time horizon involved, the type of foreign-currency asset, and market conditions. Cost considerations also affect the hedging decision. Hedging is not free: It has both direct transactional costs as well as opportunity costs (the potential for favorable outcomes is foregone). Cost considerations make a perfect hedge difficult to maintain., Views on the diversifying effects of foreign-currency exposures depend on the time horizon involved, the type of foreign-currency asset, and market conditions., Cost considerations also affect the hedging decision. Hedging is not free: It has both direct transactional costs as well as opportunity costs (the potential for favorable outcomes is foregone). Cost considerations make a perfect hedge difficult to maintain., Currency management strategies can be located along a spectrum stretching from: passive, rules-based, complete hedging of currency exposures; discretionary hedging, which allows the portfolio manager some latitude on managing currency exposures; active currency management, which seeks out currency risk in order to manage it for profit; and to currency overlay programs that aggressively manage currency “alpha.”, passive, rules-based, complete hedging of currency exposures;, discretionary hedging, which allows the portfolio manager some latitude on managing currency exposures;, active currency management, which seeks out currency risk in order to manage it for profit; and to, currency overlay programs that aggressively manage currency “alpha.”, There are a variety of methods for forming market views. The use of macroeconomic fundamentals to predict future currency movements is based on estimating the “fair value” for a currency with the expectation that spot rates will eventually converge on this equilibrium value. Technical market indicators assume that, based on market psychology, historical price patterns in the data have a tendency to repeat. Technical indicators can be used to predict support and resistance levels in the market, as well as to confirm market trends and turning points. The carry trade is based on violations of uncovered interest rate parity, and is also based on selling low-yield currencies in order to invest in high-yield currencies. This approach is equivalent to trading the forward rate bias, which means selling currencies trading at a forward premium and buying currencies trading at a forward discount. Volatility trading uses the option market to express views on the distribution of future exchange rates, not their levels., The use of macroeconomic fundamentals to predict future currency movements is based on estimating the “fair value” for a currency with the expectation that spot rates will eventually converge on this equilibrium value., Technical market indicators assume that, based on market psychology, historical price patterns in the data have a tendency to repeat.

This approach is equivalent to trading the forward rate bias, which means selling currencies trading at a forward premium and buying currencies trading at a forward discount., Volatility trading uses the option market to express views on the distribution of future exchange rates, not their levels., Passive hedging will typically use forward contracts (rather than futures contracts) because they are more flexible. However, currency futures contracts are an option for smaller trading sizes and are frequently used in private wealth management., Forward contracts have the possibility of negative roll yield (the forward points embedded in the forward price can work for or against the hedge). The portfolio manager will have to balance the advantages and costs of hedging with forward contracts., Foreign-currency options can reduce opportunity costs (they allow the upside potential for favorable foreign-currency movements). However, the upfront option premiums must be paid., There are a variety of means to reduce the cost of the hedging with either forward or option contracts, but these cost-reduction measures always involve some combination of less downside protection and/or less upside potential., Hedging multiple foreign currencies uses the same tools and strategies used in hedging a single foreign-currency exposure; except now the correlation between residual currency exposures in the portfolio should be considered., Cross hedges introduce basis risk into the portfolio, which is the risk that the correlation between exposure and its cross hedging instrument may change in unexpected ways. Forward contracts typically have very little basis risk compared with movements in the underlying spot rate., The number of trading strategies that can be used, for hedging or speculative purposes, either for a single foreign currency or multiple foreign currencies, is near infinite. The manager must assess the costs, benefits, and risks of each in the context of the investment goals and constraints of the portfolio. There is no single “correct” approach.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level3/RR_2024_L3V2R3_intro_currency_management.pdf,

This frame of reference can be as simple as the time to retirement for an individual or as complex as a balance sheet of rate-sensitive assets and liabilities for a company., Assets and liabilities can be categorized by the degree of certainty surrounding the amount and timing of cash flows. Type I assets and liabilities, such as traditional fixed-rate bonds with no embedded options, have known amounts and payment dates. For Type I assets and liabilities, such yield duration statistics as Macaulay, modified, and money duration apply., Type II, III, and IV assets and liabilities have uncertain amounts and/or uncertain timing of payment. For Type II, III, and IV assets and liabilities, curve duration statistics, such as effective duration, are needed. A model is used to obtain the estimated values when the yield curve shifts up and down by the same amount., Immunization is the process of structuring and managing a fixed-income portfolio to minimize the variance in the realized rate of return over a known investment horizon., In the case of a single liability, immunization is achieved by matching the Macaulay duration of the bond portfolio to the horizon date. As time passes and bond yields change, the duration of the bonds changes and the portfolio needs to be rebalanced. This rebalancing can be accomplished by buying and selling bonds or using interest rate derivatives, such as futures contracts and interest rate swaps., An immunization strategy aims to lock in the cash flow yield on the portfolio, which is the internal rate of return on the cash flows. It is not the weighted average of the yields to maturity on the bonds that constitute the portfolio., The risk to immunization is that as the yield curve shifts and twists, the cash flow yield on the bond portfolio does not match the change in the yield on the zero-coupon bond that would provide for perfect immunization., A sufficient, but not necessary, condition for immunization is a parallel (or shape-preserving) shift whereby all yields change by the same amount in the same direction. If the change in the cash flow yield is the same as that on the zero-coupon bond being replicated, immunization can be achieved even with a non-parallel shift to the yield curve., Structural risk to immunization arises from some non-parallel shifts and twists to the yield curve. This risk is reduced by minimizing the dispersion of cash flows in the portfolio, which can be accomplished by minimizing the convexity statistic for the portfolio. Concentrating the cash flows around the horizon date makes the immunizing portfolio closely track the zero-coupon bond that provides for perfect immunization., For multiple liabilities, one method of immunization is cash flow matching. A portfolio of high-quality zero-coupon or fixed-income bonds is purchased to match as closely as possible the amount and timing of the liabilities., A motive for cash flow matching can be accounting defeasance, whereby both the assets and liabilities are removed from the balance sheet., A laddered bond portfolio is a common investment strategy in the wealth management industry. The laddered portfolio offers “diversification” over the yield curve compared with “bullet” or “barbell” portfolios. This structure is especially attractive in stable, upwardly sloped yield curve environments as maturing short-term debt is replaced with higher-yielding long-term debt at the back of the ladder., A laddered portfolio offers an increase in convexity because the cash flows have greater dispersions than a more concentrated (bullet) portfolio., A laddered portfolio provides liquidity in that it always contains a soon-to-mature bond that could provide high-quality, low-duration collateral on a repo contract if needed., Immunization of multiple liabilities can be achieved by structuring and managing a portfolio of fixed-income bonds. Because the market values of the assets and liabilities differ, the strategy is to match the money durations. The money duration is the modified duration multiplied by the market value. The basis point value is a measure of money duration calculated by multiplying the money duration by 0.0001., The conditions to immunize multiple liabilities are that (1) the market value of assets is greater than or equal to the market value of the liabilities, (2) the asset basis point value (BPV) equals the liability BPV, and (3) the dispersion of cash flows and the convexity of assets are greater than those of the liabilities., A derivatives overlay—for example, interest rate futures contracts—can be used to immunize single or multiple liabilities., The number of futures contracts needed to immunize is the liability BPV minus the asset BPV, divided by the futures BPV. If the result is a positive number, the entity buys, or goes long, futures contracts. If the result is a negative number, the entity sells, or goes short, futures contracts. The futures BPV can be approximated by the BPV for the cheapest-to-deliver security divided by the conversion factor for the cheapest-to-deliver security., Contingent immunization adds active management of the surplus, which is the difference between the asset and liability market values, with the intent to reduce the overall cost of retiring the liabilities. In principle, any asset classes can be used for the active investment. The entity can choose to over-hedge or under-hedge the number of futures contracts needed for passive immunization., Liability-driven investing (LDI) often is used for complex rate-sensitive liabilities, such as those for a defined benefit pension plan. The retirement benefits for covered employees depend on many variables, such as years of employment, age at retirement, wage level at retirement, and expected lifetime. There are different measures for the liabilities: for instance, the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) that is based on current wages and the projected benefit obligation (PBO) that is based on expected future wages. For each liability measure (ABO or PBO), a model is used to extract the effective duration and BPV., Interest rate swap overlays can be used to reduce the duration gap as measured by the asset and liability BPVs. There often is a large gap because pension funds hold sizable asset positions in equities that have low or zero effective durations and their liability durations are high., The hedging ratio is the percentage of the duration gap that is closed with the derivatives. A hedging ratio of zero implies no hedging. A hedging ratio of 100% implies immunization—that is, complete removal of interest rate risk., Strategic hedging is the active management of the hedging ratio. Because asset BPVs are less than liability BPVs in typical pension funds, the derivatives overlay requires the use of receive-fixed interest rate swaps. Because receive-fixed swaps gain value as current swap market rates fall, the fund manager could choose to raise the hedging ratio when lower rates are anticipated. If rates are expected to go up, the manager could strategically reduce the hedging ratio., An alternative to the receive-fixed interest rate swap is a purchased receiver swaption. This swaption confers to the buyer the right to enter the swap as the fixed-rate receiver. Because of its negative duration gap (asset BPV is less than liability BPV), the typical pension plan suffers when interest rates fall and could become underfunded. The gain on the receiver swaption as rates decline offsets the losses on the balance sheet., Another alternative is a swaption collar, the combination of buying the receiver swaption and writing a payer swaption. The premium received on the payer swaption that is written offsets the premium needed to buy the receiver swaption., The choice among hedging with the receive-fixed swap, the purchased receiver swaption, and the swaption collar depends in part on the pension fund manager’s view on future interest rates., If rates are expected to be low, the receive-fixed swap typically is the preferred derivative. If rates are expected to go up, the swaption collar can become attractive. And if rates are projected to reach a certain threshold that depends on the option costs and the strike rates, the purchased receiver swaption can become the favored choice., Model risks arise in LDI strategies because of the many assumptions in the models and approximations used to measure key parameters. For example, the liability BPV for the defined benefit pension plan depends on the choice of measure (ABO or PBO) and the assumptions that go into the model regarding future events (e.g., wage levels, time of retirement, and time of death)., Spread risk in LDI strategies arises because it is common to assume equal changes in asset, liability, and hedging instrument yields when calculating the number of futures contracts, or the notional principal on an interest rate swap, to attain a particular hedging ratio. The assets and liabilities are often on corporate securities, however, and their spreads to benchmark yields can vary over time., Investing in a fund that tracks a bond market index offers the benefits of both diversification and low administrative costs. Tracking risk arises when the fund manager chooses to buy only a subset of the index, a strategy called enhanced indexing, because fully replicating the index can be impractical as a result of the large number of bonds in the fixed-income universe., Corporate bonds are often illiquid. Matrix pricing uses available data on comparable securities to estimate the fair value of the illiquid bonds., The primary risk factors encountered by an investor tracking a bond index include decisions regarding duration (option-adjusted duration for callable bonds, convexity for possible large yield shifts, and key rate durations for non-parallel shifts) and portfolio weights (assigned by sector, credit quality, maturity, coupon rate, and issuer)., Index replication is one method to establish a passive exposure to the bond market. The manager buys or sells bonds only when there are changes to the index. Full replication can be expensive, however, as well as infeasible for broad-based fixed-income indexes that include many illiquid bonds., Several enhancement strategies can reduce the costs to track a bond index: lowering trading costs, using models to identify undervalued bonds and to gauge relative value at varying points along the yield curve, over/under weighting specific credit sectors over the business cycle, and evaluating specific call features to identify value given large yield changes., Investors can obtain passive exposure to the bond market using ETFs or mutual funds. Exchange-traded fund (ETF) shares have the advantage of trading on an exchange throughout the day., A total return swap, an over-the-counter derivative, allows an institutional investor to transform an asset or liability from one asset category to another—for instance, from variable-rate cash flows referencing the MRR to the total return on a particular bond index., A total return swap (TRS) can have some advantages over a direct investment in a bond mutual fund or ETF. As a derivative, it requires less initial cash outlay than direct investment in the bond portfolio for similar performance. A TRS also carries counterparty credit risk, however. As a customized over-the-counter product, a TRS can offer exposure to assets that are difficult to access directly, such as some high-yield and commercial loan investments., Selecting a particular bond index is a major decision for a fixed-income investment manager. Selection is guided by the specified goals and objectives for the investment. The decision should recognize several features of bond indexes: (1) Given that bonds have finite maturities, the duration of the index drifts down over time; (2) the composition of the index changes over time with the business cycle and maturity preferences of issuers.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level3/RR_2024_L3V2R5_liability_driven_and_index_based_strategies.pdf,
Passive Equity Investing,2024 Curriculum,CFA Program Level III,Portfolio Management and Wealth Planning,"The member should be able to: discuss considerations in choosing a benchmark for a passively managed equity portfolio; compare passive factor-based strategies to market-capitalization-weighted indexing; compare different approaches to passive equity investing; compare the full replication, stratified sampling, and optimization approaches for the construction of passively managed equity portfolios; discuss potential causes of tracking error and methods to control tracking error for passively managed equity portfolios; explain sources of return and risk to a passively managed equity portfolio.","The member should be able to: discuss considerations in choosing a benchmark for a passively managed equity portfolio; compare passive factor-based strategies to market-capitalization-weighted indexing; compare different approaches to passive equity investing; compare the full replication, stratified sampling, and optimization approaches for the construction of passively managed equity portfolios; discuss potential causes of tracking error and methods to control tracking error for passively managed equity portfolios; explain sources of return and risk to a passively managed equity portfolio.","Active equity portfolio managers who focus on individual security selection have long been unsuccessful at beating benchmarks and have charged high management fees to their end investors. Consequently, passive investing has increased in popularity., Passive equity investors seek to track the return of benchmark indexes and construct their portfolios to reflect the characteristics of the chosen benchmarks., Selection of a benchmark is driven by the equity investor’s objectives and constraints as presented in the investment policy statement. The benchmark index must be rules-based, transparent, and investable. Specific important characteristics include the domestic or foreign market covered, the market capitalization of the constituent stocks, where the index falls in the value–growth spectrum, and other risk factors., The equity benchmark index weighting scheme is another important consideration for investors. Weighting methods include market-cap weighting, price weighting, equal weighting, and fundamental weighting. Market cap-weighting has several advantages, including the fact that weights adjust automatically., Index rebalancing and reconstitution policies are important features. Rebalancing involves adjusting the portfolio’s constituent weights after price changes, mergers, or other corporate events have caused those weights to deviate from the benchmark index. Reconstitution involves deleting names that are no longer in the index and adding names that have been approved as new index members., Increasingly, passive investors use index-based strategies to gain exposure to individual risk factors. Examples of known equity risk factors include Capitalization, Style, Yield, Momentum, Volatility, and Quality., For passive investors, portfolio tracking error is the standard deviation of the portfolio return net of the benchmark return., Indexing involves the goal of minimizing tracking error subject to realistic portfolio constraints., Methods of pursuing passive investing include the use of such pooled investments as mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), a do-it-yourself approach of building the portfolio stock-by-stock, and using derivatives to obtain exposure., Conventional open-end index mutual funds generally maintain low fees. Their expense ratios are slightly higher than for ETFs, but a brokerage fee is usually required for investor purchases and sales of ETF shares., Index exposure can also be obtained through the use of derivatives, such as futures and swaps., Building a passive portfolio by full replication, meaning to hold all the index constituents, requires a large-scale portfolio and high-quality information about the constituent characteristics. Most equity index portfolios are managed using either a full replication strategy to keep tracking error low, are sampled to keep trading costs low, or use optimization techniques to match as closely as possible the characteristics and performance of the underlying index., The principal sources of passive portfolio tracking error are fees, trading costs, and cash drag. Cash drag refers to the dilution of the return on the equity assets because of cash held. Cash drag can be exacerbated by the receipt of dividends from constituent stocks and the delay in getting them converted into shares., Portfolio managers control tracking error by minimizing trading costs, netting investor cash inflows and redemptions, and using equitization tools like derivatives to compensate for cash drag., Many index fund managers offer the constituent securities held in their portfolios for lending to short sellers and other market participants. The income earned from lending those securities helps offset portfolio management costs, often resulting in lower net fees to investors., Investor activism is engagement with portfolio companies and recognizing the primacy of end investors. Forms of activism can include expressing views to company boards or management on executive compensation, operational risk, board governance, and other value-relevant matters., Successful passive equity investment requires an understanding of the investor’s needs, benchmark index construction, and methods available to track the index.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level3/RR_2024_L3V3R4_passive_equity_investing.pdf,

Such models generally include systematic factors, which explain the average returns of a large number of risky assets. Such factors represent priced risk—risk for which investors require an additional return for bearing., The arbitrage pricing theory (APT) describes the expected return on an asset (or portfolio) as a linear function of the risk of the asset with respect to a set of factors. Like the CAPM, the APT describes a financial market equilibrium; however, the APT makes less strong assumptions., The major assumptions of the APT are as follows: Asset returns are described by a factor model. With many assets to choose from, asset-specific risk can be eliminated. Assets are priced such that there are no arbitrage opportunities., Multifactor models are broadly categorized according to the type of factor used: Macroeconomic factor models Fundamental factor models Statistical factor models, In macroeconomic factor models, the factors are surprises in macroeconomic variables that significantly explain asset class (equity in our examples) returns. Surprise is defined as actual minus forecasted value and has an expected value of zero. The factors can be understood as affecting either the expected future cash flows of companies or the interest rate used to discount these cash flows back to the present and are meant to be uncorrelated., In fundamental factor models, the factors are attributes of stocks or companies that are important in explaining cross-sectional differences in stock prices. Among the fundamental factors are book-value-to-price ratio, market capitalization, price-to-earnings ratio, and financial leverage., In contrast to macroeconomic factor models, in fundamental models the factors are calculated as returns rather than surprises. In fundamental factor models, we generally specify the factor sensitivities (attributes) first and then estimate the factor returns through regressions. In macroeconomic factor models, however, we first develop the factor (surprise) series and then estimate the factor sensitivities through regressions. The factors of most fundamental factor models may be classified as company fundamental factors, company share-related factors, or macroeconomic factors., In statistical factor models, statistical methods are applied to a set of historical returns to determine portfolios that explain historical returns in one of two senses. In factor analysis models, the factors are the portfolios that best explain (reproduce) historical return covariances. In principal-components models, the factors are portfolios that best explain (reproduce) the historical return variances., Multifactor models have applications to return attribution, risk attribution, portfolio construction, and strategic investment decisions., A factor portfolio is a portfolio with unit sensitivity to a factor and zero sensitivity to other factors., Active return is the return in excess of the return on the benchmark., Active risk is the standard deviation of active returns. Active risk is also called tracking error or tracking risk. Active risk squared can be decomposed as the sum of active factor risk and active specific risk., The information ratio (IR) is mean active return divided by active risk (tracking error). The IR measures the increment in mean active return per unit of active risk., Factor models have uses in constructing portfolios that track market indexes and in alternative index construction., Traditionally, the CAPM approach would allocate assets between the risk-free asset and a broadly diversified index fund. Considering multiple sources of systematic risk may allow investors to improve on that result by tilting away from the market portfolio. Generally, investors would gain from accepting above average (below average) exposures to risks that they have a comparative advantage (comparative disadvantage) in bearing.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level2/level2a/RR_2024_L2V5R8_using_multifactor_models.pdf,

These benefits arise from the generally low correlations of fixed-income investments with other major asset classes, such as equities., Floating-rate and inflation-linked bonds can be used to hedge inflation risk., Fixed-income investments have regular cash flows, which is beneficial for the purposes of funding future liabilities., For liability-based fixed-income mandates, portfolio construction follows two main approaches—cash flow matching and duration matching—to match fixed-income assets with future liabilities., Total return mandates are generally structured to either track or outperform a benchmark., Total return mandates can be classified into various approaches according to their target active return and active risk levels. Approaches range from pure indexing to enhanced indexing to active management., Bond Portfolio Duration is the sensitivity of a portfolio of bonds to small changes in interest rates. It can be calculated as the weighted average of time to receipt of the aggregate cash flows or, more commonly, as the weighted average of the individual bond durations that comprise the portfolio., Modified Duration of a Bond Portfolio indicates the percentage change in the market value given a change in yield-to-maturity., Convexity of a bond portfolio is a second-order effect; it operates behind duration in importance and can largely be ignored for small yield changes. When convexity is added with the use of derivatives, however, it can be extremely important to returns., Effective duration and convexity of a portfolio are the relevant summary statistics when future cash flows of bonds in a portfolio are contingent on interest rate changes., Spread duration is a useful measure for determining a portfolio’s sensitivity to changes in credit spreads. It provides the approximate percentage increase (decrease) in bond price expected for a 1% decrease (increase) in credit spread., Duration times spread is a modification of the spread duration definition to incorporate the empirical observation that spread changes across the credit spectrum tend to occur on a proportional percentage basis rather than being based on absolute basis point changes., Portfolio dispersion captures the variance of the times to receipt of cash flows around the duration. It is used in measuring interest rate immunization for liabilities., Duration management is the primary tool used by fixed-income portfolio managers., Convexity supplements duration as a measure of a bond’s price sensitivity for larger movements in interest rates. Adjusting convexity can be an important portfolio management tool., For two portfolios with the same duration, the portfolio with higher convexity has higher sensitivity to large declines in yields to maturity and lower sensitivity to large increases in yields to maturity., Interest rate derivatives can be used effectively to increase or decrease duration and convexity in a bond portfolio., Liquidity is an important consideration in fixed-income portfolio management. Bonds are generally less liquid than equities, and liquidity varies greatly across sectors., Liquidity affects pricing in fixed-income markets because many bonds either do not trade or trade infrequently., Liquidity affects portfolio construction because there is a trade-off between liquidity and yield to maturity. Less liquid bonds have higher yields to maturity, all else being equal, and may be more desirable for buy-and-hold investors. Investors anticipating liquidity needs may forgo higher yields to maturity for more liquid bonds., Investors can obtain exposure to the bond market using mutual funds and ETFs that track a bond index. Shares in mutual funds are redeemable at the net asset value with a one-day time lag., ETF shares have the advantage of trading on an exchange., A total return swap, an over-the-counter derivative, allows an institutional investor to transform an asset or liability from one asset category to another—for instance, from variable-rate cash flows referencing the market reference rate to the total return on a particular bond index., A total return swap can have some advantages over a direct investment in a bond mutual fund or ETF. As a derivative, it requires less initial cash outlay than direct investment in the bond portfolio for similar performance but carries counterparty risk., As a customized over-the-counter product, a TRS can offer exposure to assets that are difficult to access directly, such as some high-yield and commercial loan investments., When evaluating fixed-income investment strategies, it is important to consider expected returns and to understand the various components of expected returns., Decomposing expected fixed-income returns allows investors to understand the different sources of returns given expected changes in bond market conditions., A model for expected fixed-income returns can decompose them into the following components: coupon income, rolldown return, expected change in price based on investor’s views of yields to maturity and yield spreads, and expected currency gains or losses., Leverage is the use of borrowed capital to increase the magnitude of portfolio positions. By using leverage, fixed-income portfolio managers may be able to increase portfolio returns relative to what they can achieve in unleveraged portfolios. The potential for increased returns, however, comes with increased risk., Methods for leveraging fixed-income portfolios include the use of futures contracts, swap agreements, repurchase agreements, structured financial instruments, and security lending., Taxes can complicate investment decisions in fixed-income portfolio management. Complications result from the differences in taxation among investor types, countries, and income sources., The two primary sources of investment income that affect taxes for fixed-income securities are coupon payments (interest income) and capital gains or losses. Tax is usually payable only on capital gains and interest income that have actually been received., Capital gains are frequently taxed at a lower effective tax rate than interest income. If capital losses exceed capital gains in the year, they can often be “carried forward” and applied to gains in future years.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level3/RR_2024_L3V2R4_fixed_income_portfolio_management.pdf,
Yield Curve Strategies,2024 Curriculum,CFA Program Level III,Portfolio Management and Wealth Planning,"The member should be able to: describe the factors affecting fixed-income portfolio returns due to a change in benchmark yields; formulate a portfolio positioning strategy given forward interest rates and an interest rate view that coincides with the market view; formulate a portfolio positioning strategy given forward interest rates and an interest rate view that diverges from the market view in terms of rate level, slope, and shape; formulate a portfolio positioning strategy based upon expected changes in interest rate volatility; evaluate a portfolio’s sensitivity using key rate durations of the portfolio and its benchmark; discuss yield curve strategies across currencies; evaluate the expected return and risks of a yield curve strategy.","The member should be able to: describe the factors affecting fixed-income portfolio returns due to a change in benchmark yields; formulate a portfolio positioning strategy given forward interest rates and an interest rate view that coincides with the market view; formulate a portfolio positioning strategy given forward interest rates and an interest rate view that diverges from the market view in terms of rate level, slope, and shape; formulate a portfolio positioning strategy based upon expected changes in interest rate volatility; evaluate a portfolio’s sensitivity using key rate durations of the portfolio and its benchmark; discuss yield curve strategies across currencies; evaluate the expected return and risks of a yield curve strategy.","A par yield curve is a stylized representation of yields-to-maturity available to investors at various maturities, which often does not consist of traded securities but must be extracted from available bond yields using a model., Primary yield curve risk factors may be categorized by changes in level (or a parallel “shift”), slope (a flatter or steeper yield curve), and shape or curvature., Yield curve slope measures the difference between the yield-to-maturity on a long-maturity bond and the yield-to-maturity on a shorter-maturity bond. Curvature is the relationship between short-, intermediate-, and long-term yields-to-maturity., Fixed-income portfolio managers can approximate actual and anticipated bond portfolio value changes using portfolio duration and convexity measures. Duration measures the linear relationship between bond prices and yield-to-maturity. Convexity is a second-order effect describing a bond’s price behavior for larger rate movements and is affected by cash flow dispersion., A barbell portfolio combining short- and long-term bond positions will have greater convexity than a bullet portfolio concentrated in a single maturity for a given duration., Active managers seeking excess return in an expected static yield curve environment that is upward-sloping can use a buy-and-hold strategy to increase duration, roll down the yield curve, or use leverage via a carry trade in cash markets. Receive-fixed swaps and long futures positions replicate this exposure in the derivatives market., Derivatives offer the opportunity to synthetically change exposure with a far smaller initial cash outlay than cash strategies but require managers to maintain sufficient cash or eligible securities to fulfill margin or collateral requirements., Active fixed-income managers with a divergent rate level view increase duration exposure above a target if yields-to-maturity are expected to decline and reduce duration if expecting higher yields-to-maturity to minimize losses., Yield curve steepeners seek to gain from a greater spread between short- and long-term yields-to-maturity by combining a “long” short-dated bond position with a “short” long-dated bond position, while a flattener involves sale of short-term bonds and purchase of long-term bonds., Steepener and flattener strategies may be net duration neutral or net long or short duration depending upon a manager’s view of how the yield curve slope will change—that is, the relative contribution of short- and long-term yield-to-maturity changes to the expected yield curve slope change., The butterfly strategy combining a long bullet with a short barbell portfolio (or vice versa) is commonly used to capitalize on expected yield curve shape changes., Active managers capitalize on a view as to whether future realized interest rate volatility will be greater or less than implied volatility by purchasing or selling bonds with embedded options or by using stand-alone interest rate options., Stand-alone interest rate put and call options are generally based upon a bond’s price, not yield-to-maturity., Interest rate swaptions and options on bond futures are among the common tools used by active managers to alter portfolio duration and convexity subject to yield-to-maturity changes. An interest rate swaption involves the right to enter into an interest rate swap at a specific strike price in the future, while an option on a bond future involves the right, not the obligation, to buy or sell a futures contract., Key rate durations can be used in active fixed-income management to identify a bond portfolio’s sensitivity to changes in the shape of the benchmark yield curve, allowing an active manager to quantify exposures along the curve., Fixed-income managers engaged in active yield curve strategies across currencies measure excess return from active management in functional currency terms—that is, considering domestic currency returns on foreign currency assets within a portfolio., Interest rate parity establishes the fundamental relationship between spot and forward exchange rates, with a higher-yielding currency trading at a forward discount and a lower-yielding currency trading at a premium., Covered interest rate parity involves the use of a forward contract to lock in domestic currency proceeds, while uncovered interest rate parity suggests that over time, the returns on unhedged foreign currency exposure will be the same as on a domestic currency investment., Active investors use the carry trade across currencies to take advantage of divergence from interest rate parity by borrowing in a lower-yield currency and investing in a higher-yield currency., A cross-currency swap enables investors to fully hedge the domestic currency value of cash flows associated with foreign currency bonds., Active managers deviate from fully hedged foreign currency bond cash flows by entering overweight and underweight bond positions denominated in different currencies, often using an underweight position in one currency to fund an overweight position in another., Investors evaluate the expected return on an active fixed-income portfolio strategy by combining coupon income and rolldown return with expected portfolio changes based on benchmark yield-to-maturity, credit, and currency value changes over the investment horizon., Unexpected market changes or risks to portfolio value are frequently evaluated using scenario analysis.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level3/RR_2024_L3V3R1_yield_curve_strategies.pdf,
Hedge Fund Strategies,2024 Curriculum,CFA Program Level III,Portfolio Management and Wealth Planning,"The member should be able to: discuss how hedge fund strategies may be classified; discuss investment characteristics, strategy implementation, and role in a portfolio of equity-related hedge fund strategies; discuss investment characteristics, strategy implementation, and role in a portfolio of event-driven hedge fund strategies; discuss investment characteristics, strategy implementation, and role in a portfolio of relative value hedge fund strategies; discuss investment characteristics, strategy implementation, and role in a portfolio of opportunistic hedge fund strategies; discuss investment characteristics, strategy implementation, and role in a portfolio of specialist hedge fund strategies; discuss investment characteristics, strategy implementation, and role in a portfolio of multi-manager hedge fund strategies; describe how factor models may be used to understand hedge fund risk exposures; evaluate the impact of an allocation to a hedge fund strategy in a traditional investment portfolio.","The member should be able to: discuss how hedge fund strategies may be classified; discuss investment characteristics, strategy implementation, and role in a portfolio of equity-related hedge fund strategies; discuss investment characteristics, strategy implementation, and role in a portfolio of event-driven hedge fund strategies; discuss investment characteristics, strategy implementation, and role in a portfolio of relative value hedge fund strategies; discuss investment characteristics, strategy implementation, and role in a portfolio of opportunistic hedge fund strategies; discuss investment characteristics, strategy implementation, and role in a portfolio of specialist hedge fund strategies; discuss investment characteristics, strategy implementation, and role in a portfolio of multi-manager hedge fund strategies; describe how factor models may be used to understand hedge fund risk exposures; evaluate the impact of an allocation to a hedge fund strategy in a traditional investment portfolio.","Hedge funds are an important subset of the alternative investments space. Key characteristics distinguishing hedge funds and their strategies from traditional investments include the following: 1) lower legal and regulatory constraints; 2) flexible mandates permitting use of shorting and derivatives; 3) a larger investment universe on which to focus; 4) aggressive investment styles that allow concentrated positions in securities offering exposure to credit, volatility, and liquidity risk premiums; 5) relatively liberal use of leverage; 6) liquidity constraints that include lock-ups and liquidity gates; and 7) relatively high fee structures involving management and incentive fees., Hedge fund strategies are classified by a combination of the instruments in which they are invested, the trading philosophy followed, and the types of risks assumed. Some leading hedge fund strategy index providers are Hedge Fund Research; Lipper TASS; Morningstar Hedge/CISDM; Eurekahedge; and Credit Suisse. There is much heterogeneity in the classification and indexes they provide, so no one index group is all-encompassing., This reading classifies hedge fund strategies by the following categories: equity-related strategies; event-driven strategies; relative value strategies; opportunistic strategies; specialist strategies; and multi-manager strategies., Equity L/S strategies take advantage of diverse opportunities globally to create alpha via managers’ skillful stock picking. Diverse investment styles include value/growth, large cap/small cap, discretionary/quantitative, and industry specialization. Some equity L/S strategies may use index-based short hedges to reduce market risk, but most involve single name shorts for portfolio alpha and added absolute return., Equity L/S strategies are typically liquid and generally net long, with gross exposures at 70%–90% long vs. 20%–50% short (but they can vary)., Equity L/S return profiles are typically aimed to achieve average annual returns roughly equivalent to a long-only approach but with standard deviations that are 50% lower. The more market-neutral or quantitative the strategy approach, the more levered the strategy application to achieve a meaningful return profile., Dedicated short sellers only trade with short-side exposure, but they may moderate short beta by also holding cash. Short-biased managers are focused on short-side stock picking, but they typically moderate short beta with some value-oriented long exposure and cash., Dedicated short strategies tend to be 60%–120% short at all times, while short-biased strategies are typically around 30%–60% net short. The focus in both cases is usually on single equity stock picking, as opposed to index shorting, and using little if any leverage., Dedicated short-selling and short-biased strategies have return goals that are typically less than most other hedge fund strategies but with a negative correlation benefit. Returns are more volatile than a typical L/S equity hedge fund given short beta exposure., Equity market-neutral (EMN) strategies take advantage of idiosyncratic short-term mispricing between securities. Their sources of return and alpha do not require accepting beta risk, so EMN strategies are especially attractive in periods of market vulnerability/weakness. There are many types of EMN managers, but most are purely quantitative managers (vs. discretionary managers)., As many beta risks (e.g., market, sector) are hedged away, EMN strategies generally apply relatively high levels of leverage in striving for meaningful return targets., Equity market-neutral strategies exhibit relatively modest return profiles. Portfolios are aimed at market neutrality and with differing constraints to other factor/sector exposures. Generally high levels of diversification and liquidity with lower standard deviation of returns are typical due to an orientation toward mean reversion., Merger arbitrage is a relatively liquid strategy. Defined gains come from idiosyncratic, single security takeover situations, but occasional downside shocks can occur when merger deals unexpectedly fail., Cross-border M&A usually involves two sets of governmental approvals. M&A deals involving vertical integration often face antitrust scrutiny and thus carry higher risks and offer wider merger spread returns., Merger arbitrage strategies have return profiles that are insurance-like, plus a short put option, with relatively high Sharpe ratios; however, left-tail risk is associated with otherwise steady returns. Merger arbitrage managers typically apply moderate to high leverage to generate meaningful target return levels., Distressed securities strategies focus on firms in bankruptcy, facing potential bankruptcy, or under financial stress. Hedge fund managers seek inefficiently priced securities before, during, or after the bankruptcy process, which results in either liquidation or reorganization., In liquidation, the firm’s assets are sold off and securities holders are paid sequentially based on priority of their claims—from senior secured debt, junior secured debt, unsecured debt, convertible debt, preferred stock, and finally common stock., In re-organization, a firm’s capital structure is re-organized and terms for current claims are negotiated and revised. Debtholders either may agree to maturity extensions or to exchanging their debt for new equity shares (existing shares are canceled) that are sold to new investors to improve the firm’s financial condition., Outright shorts or hedged positions are possible, but distressed securities investing is usually long-biased, entails relatively high levels of illiquidity, and has moderate to low leverage. The return profile is typically at the higher end of event-driven strategies, but it is more discrete and cyclical., For fixed-income arbitrage, the attractiveness of returns is a function of the correlations between different securities, the yield spread pick-up available, and the high number and wide diversity of debt securities across different markets, each having different credit quality and convexity aspects in their pricing., Yield curve and carry trades within the US government space are very liquid but have the fewest mispricing opportunities. Liquidity for relative value positions generally decreases in other sovereign markets, mortgage-related markets, and across corporate debt markets., Fixed-income arbitrage involves high leverage usage, but leverage availability diminishes with trade and underlying instrument complexity., Convertible arbitrage strategies strive to extract “underpriced” implied volatility from long convertible bond holdings. To do this, managers will delta hedge and gamma trade short equity positions against their convertible positions. Convertible arbitrage works best in periods of high convertible issuance, moderate volatility, and reasonable market liquidity., Liquidity issues may arise from convertible bonds being naturally less-liquid securities due to their relatively small issue sizes and inherent complexities as well as the availability and cost to borrow underlying equity for short selling., Convertible arbitrage managers typically run convertible portfolios at 300% long vs. 200% short. The lower short exposure is a function of the delta-adjusted exposure needed from short sales to balance the long convertibles., Global macro strategies focus on correctly discerning and capitalizing on trends in global financial markets using a wide range of instruments. Managed futures strategies have a similar aim but focus on investments using mainly futures and options on futures, on stock and fixed-income indexes, as well as on commodities and currencies., Managed futures strategies typically are implemented via more systematic approaches, while global macro strategies tend to use more discretionary approaches. Both strategies are highly liquid and use high leverage., Returns of managed futures strategies typically exhibit positive right-tail skewness during market stress. Global macro strategies generally deliver similar diversification in stress periods but with more heterogeneous outcomes., Specialist hedge fund strategies require highly specialized skill sets for trading in niche markets. Two such typical specialist strategies—which are aimed at generating uncorrelated, attractive risk-adjusted returns—are volatility trading and reinsurance/life settlements., Volatility traders strive to capture relative timing and strike pricing opportunities due to changes in the term structure of volatility. They try to capture volatility smile and skew by using various types of option spreads, such as bull and bear spreads, straddles, and calendar spreads. In addition to using exchange-listed and OTC options, VIX futures, volatility swaps, and variance swaps can be used to implement volatility trading strategies., Life settlements strategies involve analyzing pools of life insurance contracts offered by third-party brokers, where the hedge fund purchases the pool and effectively becomes the beneficiary. The hedge fund manager looks for policies with the following traits: 1) The surrender value being offered to the insured individual is relatively low; 2) the ongoing premium payments are also relatively low; and 3) the probability is relatively high that the insured person will die sooner than predicted by standard actuarial methods., Funds-of-funds and multi-strategy funds typically offer steady, low-volatility returns via their strategy diversification. Multi-strategy funds have generally outperformed FoFs, but they have more variance due to using relatively high leverage., Multi-strategy funds offer potentially faster tactical asset allocation and generally improved fee structure (netting risk between strategies is often at least partially absorbed by the general partner), but they have higher manager-specific operational risks. FoFs offer a potentially more diverse strategy mix, but they have less transparency, slower tactical reaction time, and contribute netting risk to the FoF investor., Conditional linear factor models can be useful for uncovering and analyzing hedge fund strategy risk exposures. This reading uses such a model that incorporates four factors for assessing risk exposures in both normal periods and market stress/crisis periods: equity risk, credit risk, currency risk, and volatility risk., Adding a 20% allocation of a hedge fund strategy group to a traditional 60%/40% portfolio (for a 48% stocks/32% bonds/20% hedge funds portfolio) typically decreases total portfolio standard deviation while it increases Sharpe and Sortino ratios (and also often decreases maximum drawdown) in the combined portfolios. This demonstrates that hedge funds act as both risk-adjusted return enhancers and diversifiers for the traditional stock/bond portfolio.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level3/RR_2024_L3V4R1_hedge_fund_strategies.pdf,

It can be useful in comparing risks across asset classes, portfolios, and trading units and, as such, facilitates capital allocation decisions. It can be used for performance evaluation and can be verified by using backtesting. It is widely accepted by regulators., The primary limitations of VaR are that it is a subjective measure and highly sensitive to numerous discretionary choices made in the course of computation. It can underestimate the frequency of extreme events. It fails to account for the lack of liquidity and is sensitive to correlation risk. It is vulnerable to trending or volatility regimes and is often misunderstood as a worst-case scenario. It can oversimplify the picture of risk and focuses heavily on the left tail., There are numerous variations and extensions of VaR, including conditional VaR (CVaR), incremental VaR (IVaR), and marginal VaR (MVaR), that can provide additional useful information., Conditional VaR is the average loss conditional on exceeding the VaR cutoff., Incremental VaR measures the change in portfolio VaR as a result of adding or deleting a position from the portfolio or if a position size is changed relative to the remaining positions., MVaR measures the change in portfolio VaR given a small change in the portfolio position. In a diversified portfolio, MVaRs can be summed to determine the contribution of each asset to the overall VaR., Ex ante tracking error measures the degree to which the performance of a given investment portfolio might deviate from its benchmark., Sensitivity measures quantify how a security or portfolio will react if a single risk factor changes. Common sensitivity measures are beta for equities; duration and convexity for bonds; and delta, gamma, and vega for options. Sensitivity measures do not indicate which portfolio has greater loss potential., Risk managers can use deltas, gammas, vegas, durations, convexities, and betas to get a comprehensive picture of the sensitivity of the entire portfolio., Stress tests apply extreme negative stress to a particular portfolio exposure., Scenario measures, including stress tests, are risk models that evaluate how a portfolio will perform under certain high-stress market conditions., Scenario measures can be based on actual historical scenarios or on hypothetical scenarios., Historical scenarios are scenarios that measure the portfolio return that would result from a repeat of a particular period of financial market history., Hypothetical scenarios model the impact of extreme movements and co-movements in different markets that have not previously occurred., Reverse stress testing is the process of stressing the portfolio’s most significant exposures., Sensitivity and scenario risk measures can complement VaR. They do not need to rely on history, and scenarios can be designed to overcome an assumption of normal distributions., Limitations of scenario measures include the following: Historical scenarios are unlikely to re-occur in exactly the same way. Hypothetical scenarios may incorrectly specify how assets will co-move and thus may get the magnitude of movements wrong. And, it is difficult to establish appropriate limits on a scenario analysis or stress test., Constraints are widely used in risk management in the form of risk budgets, position limits, scenario limits, stop-loss limits, and capital allocation., Risk budgeting is the allocation of the total risk appetite across sub-portfolios., A scenario limit is a limit on the estimated loss for a given scenario, which, if exceeded, would require corrective action in the portfolio., A stop-loss limit either requires a reduction in the size of a portfolio or its complete liquidation (when a loss of a particular size occurs in a specified period)., Position limits are limits on the market value of any given investment., Risk measurements and constraints in and of themselves are not restrictive or unrestrictive; it is the limits placed on the measures that drive action., The degree of leverage, the mix of risk factors to which the business is exposed, and accounting or regulatory requirements influence the types of risk measures used by different market participants., Banks use risk tools to assess the extent of any liquidity and asset/liability mismatch, the probability of losses in their investment portfolios, their overall leverage ratio, interest rate sensitivities, and the risk to economic capital., Asset managers’ use of risk tools focuses primarily on volatility, probability of loss, or the probability of underperforming a benchmark., Pension funds use risk measures to evaluate asset/liability mismatch and surplus at risk., Property and casualty insurers use sensitivity and exposure measures to ensure exposures remain within defined asset allocation ranges. They use economic capital and VaR measures to estimate the impairment in the event of a catastrophic loss. They use scenario analysis to stress the market risks and insurance risks simultaneously., Life insurers use risk measures to assess the exposures of the investment portfolio and the annuity liability, the extent of any asset/liability mismatch, and the potential stress losses based on the differences between the assets in which they have invested and the liabilities resulting from the insurance contracts they have written.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level2/level2a/RR_2024_L2V5R9_measuring_managing_market_risk.pdf,

In the contract, two parties agree that one party, the buyer, will purchase an underlying asset from the other party, the seller, at a later date and at a price agreed on by the two parties when the contract is initiated. In addition, there is a daily settling of gains and losses and a credit guarantee by the futures exchange through its clearinghouse., A swap is an over-the-counter derivative contract in which two parties agree to exchange a series of cash flows whereby one party pays a variable series that will be determined by an underlying asset or rate and the other party pays either a variable series determined by a different underlying asset or rate or a fixed series., An option is a derivative contract in which one party, the buyer, pays a sum of money to the other party, the seller or writer, and receives the right to either buy or sell an underlying asset at a fixed price either on a specific expiration date or at any time prior to the expiration date., A call is an option that provides the right to buy the underlying., A put is an option that provides the right to sell the underlying., Credit derivatives are a class of derivative contracts between two parties, the credit protection buyer and the credit protection seller, in which the latter provides protection to the former against a specific credit loss., A credit default swap is the most widely used credit derivative. It is a derivative contract between two parties, a credit protection buyer and a credit protection seller, in which the buyer makes a series of payments to the seller and receives a promise of compensation for credit losses resulting from the default of a third party., An asset-backed security is a derivative contract in which a portfolio of debt instruments is assembled and claims are issued on the portfolio in the form of tranches, which have different priorities of claims on the payments made by the debt securities such that prepayments or credit losses are allocated to the most-junior tranches first and the most-senior tranches last., Derivatives can be combined with other derivatives or underlying assets to form hybrids., Derivatives are issued on equities, fixed-income securities, interest rates, currencies, commodities, credit, and a variety of such diverse underlyings as weather, electricity, and disaster claims., Derivatives facilitate the transfer of risk, enable the creation of strategies and payoffs not otherwise possible with spot assets, provide information about the spot market, offer lower transaction costs, reduce the amount of capital required, are easier than the underlyings to go short, and improve the efficiency of spot markets., Derivatives are sometimes criticized for being a form of legalized gambling and for leading to destabilizing speculation, although these points can generally be refuted., Derivatives are typically priced by forming a hedge involving the underlying asset and a derivative such that the combination must pay the risk-free rate and do so for only one derivative price., Derivatives pricing relies heavily on the principle of storage, meaning the ability to hold or store the underlying asset. Storage can incur costs but can also generate cash, such as dividends and interest., Arbitrage is the condition that two equivalent assets or derivatives or combinations of assets and derivatives sell for different prices, leading to an opportunity to buy at the low price and sell at the high price, thereby earning a risk-free profit without committing any capital., The combined actions of arbitrageurs bring about a convergence of prices. Hence, arbitrage leads to the law of one price: Transactions that produce equivalent results must sell for equivalent prices.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2022/pdf/derivative-markets-instruments.pdf,

Announced in May 2018, the US$62 billion deal was aimed at transforming Takeda into a top 10 global pharmaceutical company with a sizable US footprint. It was the largest deal announced worldwide for 2018. The deal was also the largest international acquisition ever attempted by a Japanese company. Takeda’s offer consisted of shares and cash. It also involved a US$30 billion increase in balance sheet debt. Takeda’s CEO undertook a nine-month-long campaign to secure the deal. The deal was confirmed in December 2018 with 88% Takeda shareholder approval, despite significant resistance from some Takeda shareholders, including the original Takeda family, who were concerned about the additional risk created by the acquisition. Takeda–Shire Deal Timeline Strategy September 2016 Takeda’s “Vision 2025” business plan envisions sustaining growth year over year. Rumor 28 March 2018 Takeda says “considering making an approach to Shire.” 6 April Takeda, Pfizer, and Amgen viewed as likely bidders for Shire. Courtship 29 March 2018 Takeda initial offer: £44/share, with £16 in cash. 11 April Takeda second offer: £45.5/share, £16.75 cash. 13 April Takeda third offer: £46.5/share, £17.75 cash. 14 April Shire’s board announces it unanimously rejects third offer. 20 April Takeda fourth offer: £47/share, £21 cash. 24 April Takeda fifth offer: £49/share, £21.75 cash. Acquisition 8 May 2018 Shire accepts fifth offer of £49/share, £21.75 cash, valuing deal at US$62 billion. 14 May Takeda announces asset disposals to help fund the acquisition. 10 July US Federal Trade Commission grants regulatory approval for Shire deal. 14 September Chinese regulator approves Shire deal. 18 October Japanese regulator approves Shire deal. 20 November EU regulator approves Shire deal. 20 November Proxy advisors Glass, Lewis & Co. and Institutional Shareholder Services recommend deal. May–November 2018 Takeda minority shareholders (including Takeda family) lobby against proposed deal, citing increased risk and loss of Japanese “roots.” Integration 5 December 2018 Takeda shareholders vote to approve deal. 7 January 2019 Takeda CEO announces integration “well underway.” 8 January 2019 Deal closes. Value creation 14 May 2019 CEO announces 43% increase in original cost synergies anticipated from acquisition. December 2019 Takeda’s core earnings margin expected to reach 25%, with long-term earnings margin forecast for 35%, up from an earnings margin of 22% in 2018. March 2020 Takeda sales expected to rise 57% year over year. Projection for 2023 Divestments of US$10 billion expected to stabilize balance sheet, with the expansion of five key businesses including in neuroscience and in treatments for cancer and rare diseases. Takeda’s motivations for the deal included the potential for sustainable earnings growth believed to be available through Shire’s products and markets. Takeda was at that time projecting declining profitability from existing products and limited growth in the Japanese market. Additionally, synergies through new product development, earnings diversification, and cost savings were anticipated from the deal. Despite positive expectations, in the nine months between Takeda’s announcement in March 2018 and the time the deal closed, Takeda’s share price dropped 26% while Shire’s rose 33%. Following increasing offers in value by Takeda, a series of regulatory approvals post–Shire acceptance, and announcements of a divestments program to help fund the acquisition, the deal finally closed in January 2019. By May 2019, Takeda’s management was reporting significant cost savings and projecting major improvements to core earnings margins in the years ahead.","An acquisition is the purchase of some portion of one company by another. A merger represents the absorption of one company by another such that only one entity survives following the transaction., Mergers can be categorized by the form of integration. In a statutory merger, one company is merged into another; in a subsidiary merger, the target becomes a subsidiary of the acquirer; and in a consolidation, both the acquirer and target become part of a newly formed company., Horizontal mergers occur among peer companies engaged in the same kind of business. Vertical mergers occur among companies along a given value chain. Conglomerates are formed by companies in unrelated businesses., Merger activity tends to be concentrated in industries undergoing changes, such as deregulation or technological advancement., The motives for M&A activity include synergy, growth, market power, the acquisition of unique capabilities and resources, diversification, increased earnings, management’s personal incentives, tax considerations, and the possibilities of uncovering hidden value. Cross-border motivations may involve technology transfer, product differentiation, government policy, and the opportunities to serve existing clients abroad., A merger transaction may take the form of a stock purchase (when the acquirer gives the target company’s shareholders some combination of cash or securities in exchange for shares of the target company’s stock) or an asset purchase (when the acquirer purchases the target company’s assets and payment is made directly to the target company). The decision of which approach to take will affect other aspects of the transaction, such as how approval is obtained, which laws apply, how the liabilities are treated, and how the shareholders and the company are taxed., The method of payment for a merger can be cash, securities, or a mixed offering with some of both. The exchange ratio in a stock or mixed offering determines the number of shares that stockholders in the target company will receive in exchange for each of their shares in the target company., Hostile transactions are those opposed by target managers, whereas friendly transactions are endorsed by the target company’s managers. There are a variety of both pre- and post-offer defenses a target can use to ward off an unwanted takeover bid., Examples of pre-offer defense mechanisms include poison pills and puts, incorporation in a jurisdiction with restrictive takeover laws, staggered boards of directors, restricted voting rights, supermajority voting provisions, fair price amendments, and golden parachutes., Examples of post-offer defenses include the “just say no” defense, litigation, greenmail, share repurchases, leveraged recapitalization, “crown jewel” defense, Pac-Man® defense, or finding a white knight or a white squire., Competition law prohibits mergers and acquisitions that impede competition., Three major tools for valuing a target company are discounted cash flow analysis (which involves discounting free cash flows estimated with pro forma financial statements), comparable company analysis (which estimates a company’s intrinsic value based on relative valuation metrics for similar companies), and comparable transaction analysis (which derives valuation from details of recent takeover transactions for comparable companies)., In a merger bid, the gain to target shareholders is measured as the control premium, which equals the price paid for the target company in excess of its value. The acquirer gains equal the value of any synergies created by the merger minus the premium paid to target shareholders. Together, the bid and the method of payment determine the distribution of risks and returns among acquirer and target shareholders with regard to realization of synergies as well as correct estimation of the target company’s value., The empirical evidence suggests that merger transactions create value for target company shareholders. Acquirers, in contrast, tend to accrue value in the years following a merger. This finding suggests that synergies are often overestimated or difficult to achieve., When a company decides to sell, liquidate, or spin off a division or a subsidiary, it is referred to as a divestiture. Companies may divest assets for a variety of reasons, including a change in strategic focus, poor fit of the asset within the corporation, reverse synergy, or cash flow needs., The three basic ways that a company divests assets are a sale to another company, a spin-off to shareholders, and liquidation.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2022/pdf/mergers-acquisitions.pdf,

The annuity due has a first cash flow that occurs immediately; the ordinary annuity has a first cash flow that occurs one period from the present (indexed at t = 1)., On a time line, we can index the present as 0 and then display equally spaced hash marks to represent a number of periods into the future. This representation allows us to index how many periods away each cash flow will be paid., Annuities may be handled in a similar approach as single payments if we use annuity factors rather than single-payment factors., The present value, PV, is the future value, FV, times the present value factor, (1 + r)−N., The present value of a perpetuity is A/r, where A is the periodic payment to be received forever., It is possible to calculate an unknown variable, given the other relevant variables in time value of money problems., The cash flow additivity principle can be used to solve problems with uneven cash flows by combining single payments and annuities.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level1a/RR_2024_L1V1R2_time_value_money.pdf,

The key factors are current income, price appreciation, inflation hedge, diversification, and tax benefits., Adding equity real estate investments to a traditional portfolio will potentially have diversification benefits because of the less-than-perfect correlation of equity real estate returns with returns to stocks and bonds., If the income stream can be adjusted for inflation and real estate prices increase with inflation, then equity real estate investments may provide an inflation hedge., Debt investors in real estate expect to receive their return from promised cash flows and typically do not participate in any appreciation in value of the underlying real estate. Thus, debt investments in real estate are similar to other fixed-income investments, such as bonds., Regardless of the form of real estate investment, the value of the underlying real estate property can affect the performance of the investment with location being a critical factor in determining the value of a real estate property., Real estate property has some unique characteristics compared with other investment asset classes. These characteristics include heterogeneity and fixed location, high unit value, management intensiveness, high transaction costs, depreciation, sensitivity to the credit market, illiquidity, and difficulty of value and price determination., There are many different types of real estate properties in which to invest. The main commercial (income-producing) real estate property types are office, industrial and warehouse, retail, and multifamily. Other types of commercial properties typically are classified by their specific use., Certain risk factors are common to commercial property, but each property type is likely to have a different susceptibility to these factors. The key risk factors that can affect commercial real estate include business condition, lead time for new development, excess supply, cost and availability of capital, unexpected inflation, demographics, lack of liquidity, environmental issues, availability of information, management expertise, and leverage., Location, lease structures, and economic factors—such as economic growth, population growth, employment growth, and consumer spending—affect the value of each property type.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level2/level2a/RR_2024_L2V5R4_real_estate_investment_overview.pdf,

In a company, both the board of directors and management act in an agent capacity to represent the interests of shareholder principals., Conflicts occur when the interests of various stakeholder groups diverge and when the interests of one group are compromised for the benefit of another., Stakeholder management involves identifying, prioritizing, and understanding the interests of stakeholder groups and managing the company’s relationships with stakeholders., Mechanisms to mitigate shareholder risks include company reporting and transparency, general meetings, investor activism, derivative lawsuits, and corporate takeovers., Mechanisms to mitigate creditor risks include bond indenture(s), company reporting and transparency, and committee participation., Mechanisms to mitigate board risks include board or management meetings and board committees., Remaining mechanisms to mitigate risks for other stakeholder (employees, customers, suppliers, and regulators) include policies, laws, regulations, and codes., Executive (internal) directors are employed by the company and are typically members of senior management. Nonexecutive (external) directors have limited involvement in daily operations but serve an important oversight role., Two primary duties of a board of directors are duty of care and duty of loyalty., A company’s board of directors typically has several committees that are responsible for specific functions and report to the board. Although the types of committees may vary across organization, the most common are the audit committee, governance committee, remuneration (compensation) committee, nomination committee, risk committee, and investment committee., Shareholder activism encompasses a range of strategies that may be used by shareholders when seeking to compel a company to act in a desired manner., From a corporation’s perspective, risks of poor governance include weak control systems; ineffective decision making; and legal, regulatory, reputational, and default risk. Benefits include better operational efficiency, control, and operating and financial performance, as well as lower default risk (or cost of debt), which enhances shareholder value., Key analyst considerations in corporate governance and stakeholder management include economic ownership and voting control, board of directors’ representation, remuneration and company performance, investor composition, strength of shareholders’ rights, and the management of long-term risks., Environmental and social issues, such as climate change, air pollution, and societal impacts of a company’s products and services, historically have been treated as negative externalities., Increased stakeholder awareness and strengthening regulations, however, are internalizing environmental and societal costs into the company’s income statement by responsible investors., ESG investment approaches are value based or values based.

OTC derivatives constitute the greater proportion of derivatives in existence and are unregulated, whereas derivatives traded on exchanges are standardized. OTC derivatives generally have greater risk for the counterparty than do standardized derivatives.",,,

The principles of capital budgeting have been applied to other corporate investing and financing decisions and to security analysis and portfolio management., The typical steps in the capital budgeting process are: 1) generating ideas, 2) analyzing individual proposals, 3) planning the capital budget, and 4) monitoring and post-auditing., Types of projects appropriate for the capital budgeting process can be categorized as: 1) replacement, 2) expansion, 3) new products and services, and 4) regulatory, safety and environmental., Capital budgeting decisions are based on incremental after-tax cash flows discounted at the opportunity cost of funds. Financing costs are ignored because both the cost of debt and the cost of other capital are captured in the discount rate., The net present value (NPV) is the present value of all after-tax cash flows, or NPV=∑t=0nCFt(1+r)t where the investment outlays are negative cash flows included in the CFts and where r is the required rate of return for the investment., The IRR is the discount rate that makes the present value of all future cash flows sum to zero. This equation can be solved for the IRR: ∑t=0nCFt(1+IRR)t=0, The payback period is the number of years required to recover the original investment in a project. The payback is based on cash flows., The discounted payback period is the number of years it takes for the cumulative discounted cash flows from a project to equal the original investment., The average accounting rate of return (AAR) can be defined as follows: AAR=Average net incomeAverage book value, The profitability index (PI) is the present value of a project’s future cash flows divided by the initial investment: PI=PV of future cash flowsInitial investment=1+NPVInitial investment, The capital budgeting decision rules are to invest if the NPV > 0, if the IRR > r, or if the PI > 1.0 There are no decision rules for the payback period, discounted payback period, and AAR because they are not always sound measures., The NPV profile is a graph that shows a project’s NPV graphed as a function of various discount rates., For mutually exclusive projects that are ranked differently by the NPV and IRR, it is economically sound to choose the project with the higher NPV., The “multiple IRR problem” and the “no IRR problem” can arise for a project with nonconventional cash flows—cash flows that change signs more than once during the project’s life., The fact that projects with positive NPVs theoretically increase the value of the company and the value of its stock could explain the popularity of NPV as an evaluation method.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2021/pdf/capital-budgeting-l1.pdf,

These totals are then used to find an NPV or IRR. Alternatively, tables collecting cash flows by type can be used. Equations for the capital budgeting cash flows are as follows: Initial outlay: Outlay = FCInv + NWCInv − Sal 0 + t ( Sal 0 − B 0 ) Annual after-tax operating cash flow: CF = ( S − C − D ) ( 1 − t ) + D, or CF = ( S − C ) ( 1 − t ) + t D Terminal year after-tax non-operating cash flow: TNOCF = Sal T + NWCInv − t ( Sal T − B T ), Depreciation schedules affect taxable income, taxes paid, and after-tax cash flows, and therefore capital budgeting valuations., When inflation exists, the analyst should perform capital budgeting analysis in “nominal” terms if cash flows are nominal and in “real” terms if cash flows are real., Inflation reduces the value of depreciation tax savings (unless the tax system adjusts depreciation for inflation). Inflation reduces the value of fixed payments to bondholders. Inflation usually does not affect all revenues and costs uniformly. Contracting with customers, suppliers, employees, and sources of capital can be complicated as inflation rises., Two ways of comparing mutually exclusive projects in a replacement chain are the “least common multiple of lives” approach and the “equivalent annual annuity” approach., For the least common multiple of lives approach, the analyst extends the time horizon of analysis so that the lives of both projects will divide exactly into the horizon. The projects are replicated over this horizon, and the NPV for the total cash flows over the least common multiple of lives is used to evaluate the investments., The equivalent annual annuity is the annuity payment (series of equal annual payments over the project’s life) that is equivalent in value to the project’s actual cash flows. Analysts find the present value of all of the cash flows for an investment (the NPV) and then calculate an annuity payment that has a value equivalent to the NPV., With capital rationing, the company’s capital budget has a size constraint. Under “hard” capital rationing, the budget is fixed. In the case of hard rationing, managers use trial and error and sometimes mathematical programming to find the optimal set of projects. In that situation, it is best to use the NPV or PI valuation methods., Sensitivity analysis calculates the effect on the NPV of changes in one input variable at a time., Scenario analysis creates scenarios that consist of changes in several of the input variables and calculates the NPV for each scenario., Simulation (Monte Carlo) analysis is used to estimate probability distributions for the NPV or IRR of a capital project. Simulations randomly select values for stochastic input variables and then repeatedly calculate the project NPV and IRR to find their distributions., Real options can be classified as 1) timing options; 2) sizing options, which can be abandonment options or growth (expansion) options; 3) flexibility options, which can be price-setting options or production-flexibility options; and 4) fundamental options.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2021/pdf/capital-budgeting-l2.pdf,

By doing this, the bond value is arbitrage free., An option-free bond that is valued by using the binomial interest rate tree should have the same value as discounting by the spot rates., Pathwise valuation calculates the present value of a bond for each possible interest rate path and takes the average of these values across paths., The Monte Carlo method is an alternative method for simulating a sufficiently large number of potential interest rate paths in an effort to discover how the value of a security is affected and involves randomly selecting paths in an effort to approximate the results of a complete pathwise valuation.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2021/pdf/arbitrage-free-valuation-framework.pdf,

Only cash dividends are payments to shareholders. Stock dividends and splits merely carve equity into smaller pieces and do not create wealth for shareholders. Reverse stock splits usually occur after a stock has dropped to a very low price and do not affect shareholder wealth., Regular cash dividends—unlike irregular cash dividends, stock splits, and stock dividends—represent a commitment to pay cash to stockholders on a quarterly, semiannual, or annual basis., There are three general theories on investor preference for dividends. The first, MM, argues that given perfect markets dividend policy is irrelevant. The second, “bird in hand” theory, contends that investors value a dollar of dividends today more than uncertain capital gains in the future. The third theory argues that in countries in which dividends are taxed at higher rates than capital gains, taxable investors prefer that companies reinvest earnings in profitable growth opportunities or repurchase shares so they receive more of the return in the form of capital gains., An argument for dividend irrelevance given perfect markets is that corporate dividend policy is irrelevant because shareholders can create their preferred cash flow stream by selling the company’s shares (“homemade dividends”)., Dividend declarations may provide information to current and prospective shareholders regarding management’s confidence in the prospects of the company. Initiating a dividend or increasing a dividend sends a positive signal, whereas cutting a dividend or omitting a dividend typically sends a negative signal. In addition, some institutional and individual shareholders see regular cash dividend payments as a measure of investment quality., Payment of dividends can help reduce the agency conflicts between managers and shareholders, but it also can worsen conflicts of interest between shareholders and debtholders., Empirically, several factors appear to influence dividend policy, including investment opportunities for the company, the volatility expected in its future earnings, financial flexibility, tax considerations, flotation costs, and contractual and legal restrictions., Under double taxation systems, dividends are taxed at both the corporate and shareholder level. Under tax imputation systems, a shareholder receives a tax credit on dividends for the tax paid on corporate profits. Under split-rate taxation systems, corporate profits are taxed at different rates depending on whether the profits are retained or paid out in dividends., Companies with outstanding debt often are restricted in the amount of dividends they can pay because of debt covenants and legal restrictions. Some institutions require that a company pay a dividend to be on their “approved” investment list. If a company funds capital expenditures by borrowing while paying earnings out in dividends, it will incur flotation costs on new debt issues., Using a stable dividend policy, a company tries to align its dividend growth rate to the company’s long-term earnings growth rate. Dividends may increase even in years when earnings decline, and dividends will increase at a lower rate than earnings in boom years., A stable dividend policy can be represented by a gradual adjustment process in which the expected dividend is equal to last year’s dividend per share plus [(Expected earnings × Target payout ratio − Previous dividend) × Adjustment factor]., Using a constant dividend payout ratio policy, a company applies a target dividend payout ratio to current earnings; therefore, dividends are more volatile than with a stable dividend policy., Share repurchases, or buybacks, most often occur in the open market. Alternatively, tender offers occur at a fixed price or at a price range through a Dutch auction. Shareholders who do not tender increase their relative position in the company. Direct negotiations with major shareholders to get them to sell their positions are less common because they could destroy value for remaining stockholders., Share repurchases made with excess cash have the potential to increase earnings per share, whereas share repurchases made with borrowed funds can increase, decrease, or not affect earnings per share depending on the company’s after-tax borrowing rate and earnings yield., A share repurchase is equivalent to the payment of a cash dividend of equal amount in its effect on total shareholders’ wealth, all other things being equal., If the buyback market price per share is greater (less) than the book value per share, then the book value per share will decrease (increase)., Companies can repurchase shares in lieu of increasing cash dividends. Share repurchases usually offer company management more flexibility than cash dividends by not establishing the expectation that a particular level of cash distribution will be maintained., Companies can pay regular cash dividends supplemented by share repurchases. In years of extraordinary increases in earnings, share repurchases can substitute for special cash dividends., On the one hand, share repurchases can signal that company officials think their shares are undervalued. On the other hand, share repurchases could send a negative signal that the company has few positive NPV opportunities., Analysts are interested in how safe a company’s dividend is, specifically whether the company’s earnings and, more importantly, its cash flow are sufficient to sustain the payment of the dividend., Early warning signs of whether a company can sustain its dividend include the dividend coverage ratio, the level of dividend yield, whether the company borrows to pay the dividend, and the company’s past dividend record.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2021/pdf/analysis-dividends-share-repurchases.pdf,

Transfer payments and capital gains are excluded from GDP., With the exception of owner-occupied housing and government services, which are estimated at imputed values, GDP includes only goods and services that are valued by being sold in the market., Intermediate goods are excluded from GDP in order to avoid double counting., GDP can be measured either from the value of final output or by summing the value added at each stage of the production and distribution process. The sum of the value added by each stage is equal to the final selling price of the good., Nominal GDP is the value of production using the prices of the current year. Real GDP measures production using the constant prices of a base year. The GDP deflator equals the ratio of nominal GDP to real GDP., Households earn income in exchange for providing—directly or indirectly through ownership of businesses—the factors of production (labor, capital, natural resources including land). From this income, they consume, save, and pay net taxes., Businesses produce most of the economy’s output/income and invest to maintain and expand productive capacity. Companies retain some earnings but pay out most of their revenue as income to the household sector and as taxes to the government., The government sector collects taxes from households and businesses and purchases goods and services, for both consumption and investment, from the private business sector., Foreign trade consists of exports and imports. The difference between the two is net exports. If net exports are positive (negative), then the country spends less (more) than it earns. Net exports are balanced by accumulation of either claims on the rest of the world (net exports > 0) or obligations to the rest of the world (net exports < 0)., Capital markets provide a link between saving and investment in the economy., From the expenditure side, GDP includes personal consumption (C), gross private domestic investment (I), government spending (G), and net exports (X – M)., The major categories of expenditure are often broken down into subcategories. Gross private domestic investment includes both investment in fixed assets (plant and equipment) and the change in inventories. In some countries, government spending on investment is separated from other government spending., National income is the income received by all factors of production used in the generation of final output. It equals GDP minus the capital consumption allowance (depreciation) and a statistical discrepancy., Personal income reflects pre-tax income received by households. It equals national income plus transfers minus undistributed corporate profits, corporate income taxes, and indirect business taxes., Personal disposable income equals personal income minus personal taxes., Private saving must equal investment plus the fiscal and trade deficits. That is, S = I + (G – T) + (X – M)., Consumption spending is a function of disposable income. The marginal propensity to consume represents the fraction of an additional unit of disposable income that is spent., Investment spending depends on the average interest rate and the level of aggregate income. Government purchases and tax policy are often considered to be exogenous variables determined outside the macroeconomic model. Actual taxes collected depend on income and are, therefore, endogenous—that is, determined within the model., The IS curve reflects combinations of GDP and the real interest rate such that aggregate income/output equals planned expenditures. The LM curve reflects combinations of GDP and the interest rate such that demand and supply of real money balances are equal., Combining the IS and LM relationships yields the aggregate demand curve., Aggregate demand and aggregate supply determine the level of real GDP and the price level., The aggregate demand curve is the relationship between real output (GDP) demanded and the price level, holding underlying factors constant. Movements along the aggregate demand curve reflect the impact of price on demand., The aggregate demand curve is downward sloping because a rise in the price level reduces wealth, raises real interest rates, and raises the price of domestically produced goods versus foreign goods. The aggregate demand curve is drawn assuming a constant money supply., The aggregate demand curve will shift if there is a change in a factor, other than price, that affects aggregate demand. These factors include household wealth, consumer and business expectations, capacity utilization, monetary policy, fiscal policy, exchange rates, and foreign GDP., The aggregate supply curve is the relationship between the quantity of real GDP supplied and the price level, keeping all other factors constant. Movements along the supply curve reflect the impact of price on supply., The short-run aggregate supply curve is upward sloping because higher prices result in higher profits and induce businesses to produce more and laborers to work more. In the short run, some prices are sticky, implying that some prices do not adjust to changes in demand., In the long run, all prices are assumed to be flexible. The long-run aggregate supply curve is vertical because input costs adjust to changes in output prices, leaving the optimal level of output unchanged. The position of the curve is determined by the economy’s level of potential GDP., The level of potential output, also called the full employment or natural level of output, is unobservable and difficult to measure precisely. This concept represents an efficient and unconstrained level of production at which companies have enough spare capacity to avoid bottlenecks and there is a balance between the pool of unemployed workers and the pool of job openings., The long-run aggregate supply curve will shift because of changes in labor supply, supply of physical and human capital, and productivity/technology., The short-run supply curve will shift because of changes in potential GDP, nominal wages, input prices, expectations about future prices, business taxes and subsidies, and the exchange rate., The business cycle and short-term fluctuations in GDP are caused by shifts in aggregate demand and aggregate supply., When the level of GDP in the economy is below potential GDP, such a recessionary situation exerts downward pressure on the aggregate price level., When the level of GDP is above potential GDP, such an overheated situation puts upward pressure on the aggregate price level., Stagflation, a combination of high inflation and weak economic growth, is caused by a decline in short-run aggregate supply., The sustainable rate of economic growth is measured by the rate of increase in the economy’s productive capacity or potential GDP., Growth in real GDP measures how rapidly the total economy is expanding. Per capita GDP, defined as real GDP divided by population, reflects the standard of living in a country. Real GDP growth rates and levels of per capita GDP vary widely among countries., The sources of economic growth include the supply of labor, the supply of physical and human capital, raw materials, and technological knowledge., Output can be described in terms of a production function. For example, Y = AF(L,K) where L is the quantity of labor, K is the capital stock, and A represents technological knowledge or total factor productivity. The function F(·) is assumed to exhibit constant returns to scale but diminishing marginal productivity for each input individually., Total factor productivity is a scale factor that reflects the portion of output growth that is not accounted for by changes in the capital and labor inputs. TFP is mainly a reflection of technological change., Based on a two-factor production function, Potential GDP growth = Growth in TFP + WL (Growth in labor) + WC (Growth in capital), where WL and WC (= 1 – WL) are the shares of labor and capital in GDP., Diminishing marginal productivity implies that increasing the supply of some input(s) relative to other inputs will lead to diminishing returns and cannot be the basis for sustainable growth. In particular, long-term sustainable growth cannot rely solely on capital deepening, that is, increasing the stock of capital relative to labor. given the relative scarcity and hence high productivity of capital in developing countries, the growth rate of developing countries should exceed that of developed countries., increasing the supply of some input(s) relative to other inputs will lead to diminishing returns and cannot be the basis for sustainable growth.

Adding the tax shield provided by debt to the Modigliani and Miller framework suggests that the optimal capital structure is all debt., In the Modigliani and Miller propositions with and without taxes, increasing a company’s relative use of debt in the capital structure increases the risk for equity providers and, hence, the cost of equity capital., When there are bankruptcy costs, a high debt ratio increases the risk of bankruptcy., Using more debt in a company’s capital structure reduces the net agency costs of equity., The costs of asymmetric information increase as more equity is used versus debt, suggesting the pecking order theory of leverage in which new equity issuance is the least preferred method of raising capital., According to the static trade-off theory of capital structure, in choosing a capital structure, a company balances the value of the tax benefit from deductibility of interest with the present value of the costs of financial distress. At the optimal target capital structure, the incremental tax shield benefit is exactly offset by the incremental costs of financial distress., A company may identify its target capital structure, but its capital structure at any point in time may not be equal to its target for many reasons., Many companies have goals for maintaining a certain credit rating, and these goals are influenced by the relative costs of debt financing among the different rating classes., In evaluating a company’s capital structure, the financial analyst must look at such factors as the capital structure of the company over time, the business risk of the company, the capital structure of competitors that have similar business risk, and company-specific factors (e.g., the quality of corporate governance, which may affect agency costs)., Good corporate governance and accounting transparency should lower the net agency costs of equity., When comparing capital structures of companies in different countries, an analyst must consider a variety of characteristics that might differ and affect both the typical capital structure and the debt maturity structure. The major characteristics fall into three categories: institutional and legal environment, financial markets and banking sector, and macroeconomic environment.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2021/pdf/capital-structure.pdf,

these cash flows are the only reason for early exercise of a call., American put prices can differ from European put prices, because the right to exercise early always has value for a put, which is because of a lower limit on the value of the underlying.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2021/pdf/basics-derivative-pricing-valuation.pdf,

Discrete random variables take on at most a countable number of possible outcomes that we can list as x 1, x 2, … In contrast, we cannot describe the possible outcomes of a continuous random variable Z with a list z 1, z 2, … because the outcome (z 1 + z 2)/2, not in the list, would always be possible., The probability function specifies the probability that the random variable will take on a specific value. The probability function is denoted p(x) for a discrete random variable and f(x) for a continuous random variable. For any probability function p(x), 0 ≤ p(x) ≤ 1, and the sum of p(x) over all values of X equals 1., The cumulative distribution function, denoted F(x) for both continuous and discrete random variables, gives the probability that the random variable is less than or equal to x., The discrete uniform and the continuous uniform distributions are the distributions of equally likely outcomes., The binomial random variable is defined as the number of successes in n Bernoulli trials, where the probability of success, p, is constant for all trials and the trials are independent. A Bernoulli trial is an experiment with two outcomes, which can represent success or failure, an up move or a down move, or another binary (two-fold) outcome., A binomial random variable has an expected value or mean equal to np and variance equal to np(1 − p)., A binomial tree is the graphical representation of a model of asset price dynamics in which, at each period, the asset moves up with probability p or down with probability (1 − p). The binomial tree is a flexible method for modeling asset price movement and is widely used in pricing options., The normal distribution is a continuous symmetric probability distribution that is completely described by two parameters: its mean, μ, and its variance, σ2., A univariate distribution specifies the probabilities for a single random variable. A multivariate distribution specifies the probabilities for a group of related random variables., To specify the normal distribution for a portfolio when its component securities are normally distributed, we need the means, standard deviations, and all the distinct pairwise correlations of the securities. When we have those statistics, we have also specified a multivariate normal distribution for the securities., For a normal random variable, approximately 68 percent of all possible outcomes are within a one standard deviation interval about the mean, approximately 95 percent are within a two standard deviation interval about the mean, and approximately 99 percent are within a three standard deviation interval about the mean., A normal random variable, X, is standardized using the expression Z = (X − μ)/σ, where μ and σ are the mean and standard deviation of X. Generally, we use the sample mean X ¯ as an estimate of μ and the sample standard deviation s as an estimate of σ in this expression., The standard normal random variable, denoted Z, has a mean equal to 0 and variance equal to 1. All questions about any normal random variable can be answered by referring to the cumulative distribution function of a standard normal random variable, denoted N(x) or N(z)., Shortfall risk is the risk that portfolio value will fall below some minimum acceptable level over some time horizon., Roy’s safety-first criterion, addressing shortfall risk, asserts that the optimal portfolio is the one that minimizes the probability that portfolio return falls below a threshold level. According to Roy’s safety-first criterion, if returns are normally distributed, the safety-first optimal portfolio P is the one that maximizes the quantity [E(RP ) − RL ]/σ P , where RL is the minimum acceptable level of return., A random variable follows a lognormal distribution if the natural logarithm of the random variable is normally distributed. The lognormal distribution is defined in terms of the mean and variance of its associated normal distribution. The lognormal distribution is bounded below by 0 and skewed to the right (it has a long right tail)., The lognormal distribution is frequently used to model the probability distribution of asset prices because it is bounded below by zero., Continuous compounding views time as essentially continuous or unbroken; discrete compounding views time as advancing in discrete finite intervals., The continuously compounded return associated with a holding period is the natural log of 1 plus the holding period return, or equivalently, the natural log of ending price over beginning price., If continuously compounded returns are normally distributed, asset prices are lognormally distributed. This relationship is used to move back and forth between the distributions for return and price. Because of the central limit theorem, continuously compounded returns need not be normally distributed for asset prices to be reasonably well described by a lognormal distribution., Monte Carlo simulation involves the use of a computer to represent the operation of a complex financial system. A characteristic feature of Monte Carlo simulation is the generation of a large number of random samples from specified probability distribution(s) to represent the operation of risk in the system. Monte Carlo simulation is used in planning, in financial risk management, and in valuing complex securities. Monte Carlo simulation is a complement to analytical methods but provides only statistical estimates, not exact results.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2021/pdf/common-probability-distributions.pdf,

Data cleansing typically involves resolving incompleteness errors, invalidity errors, inaccuracy errors, inconsistency errors, non-uniformity errors, and duplication errors., Preprocessing for structured data typically involves performing the following transformations: extraction, aggregation, filtration, selection, and conversion., Preparation and wrangling text (unstructured) data involves a set of text-specific cleansing and preprocessing tasks. Text cleansing typically involves removing the following: html tags, punctuations, most numbers, and white spaces., Text preprocessing requires performing normalization that involves the following: lowercasing, removing stop words, stemming, lemmatization, creating bag-of-words (BOW) and n-grams, and organizing the BOW and n-grams into a document term matrix (DTM)., Data exploration encompasses exploratory data analysis, feature selection, and feature engineering. Whereas histograms, box plots, and scatterplots are common techniques for exploring structured data, word clouds are an effective way to gain a high-level picture of the composition of textual content. These visualization tools help share knowledge among the team (business subject matter experts, quants, technologists, etc.) to help derive optimal solutions., Feature selection methods used for text data include term frequency, document frequency, chi-square test, and a mutual information measure. Feature engineering for text data includes converting numbers into tokens, creating n-grams, and using name entity recognition and parts of speech to engineer new feature variables., The model training steps (method selection, performance evaluation, and model tuning) often do not differ much for structured versus unstructured data projects., Model selection is governed by the following factors: whether the data project involves labeled data (supervised learning) or unlabeled data (unsupervised learning); the type of data (numerical, continuous, or categorical; text data; image data; speech data; etc.); and the size of the dataset., Model performance evaluation involves error analysis using confusion matrixes, determining receiver operating characteristics, and calculating root mean square error., To carry out an error analysis for each model, a confusion matrix is created; true positives (TPs), true negatives (TNs), false positives (FPs), and false negatives (FNs) are determined. Then, the following performance metrics are calculated: accuracy, F1 score, precision, and recall. The higher the accuracy and F1 score, the better the model performance., To carry out receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, ROC curves and area under the curve (AUC) of various models are calculated and compared. The more convex the ROC curve and the higher the AUC, the better the model performance., Model tuning involves managing the trade-off between model bias error, associated with underfitting, and model variance error, associated with overfitting. A fitting curve of in-sample (training sample) error and out-of-sample (cross-validation sample) error on the y-axis versus model complexity on the x-axis is useful for managing the bias vs. variance error trade-off., In a real-world big data project involving text data analysis for classifying and predicting sentiment of financial text for particular stocks, the text data are transformed into structured data for populating the DTM, which is then used as the input for the ML algorithm., To derive term frequency (TF) at the sentence level and TF–IDF, both of which can be inputs to the DTM, the following frequency measures should be used to create a term frequency measures table: TotalWordsInSentence; TotalWordCount; TermFrequency (Collection Level); WordCountInSentence; SentenceCountWithWord; Document Frequency; and Inverse Document Frequency.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2021/pdf/big-data-projects.pdf,

This difference in returns might be positive or negative after the fact but would be expected to be positive before the fact or active management would not be justified., Value added is related to active weights in the portfolio, defined as differences between the various asset weights in the managed portfolio and their weights in the benchmark portfolio. Individual assets can be overweighted (have positive active weights) or underweighted (have negative active weights), but the complete set of active weights sums to zero., Positive value added is generated when positive-active-weight assets have larger returns than negative-active-weight assets. By defining individual asset active returns as the difference between the asset total return and the benchmark return, value added is shown to be positive if and only if end-of-period realized active asset returns are positively correlated with the active asset weights established at the beginning of the period., Value added can come from a variety of active portfolio management decisions, including security selection, asset class allocation, and even further decompositions into economic sector weightings and geographic or country weights., The Sharpe ratio measures reward per unit of risk in absolute returns, whereas the information ratio measures reward per unit of risk in benchmark relative returns. Either ratio can be applied ex ante to expected returns or ex post to realized returns. The information ratio is a key criterion on which to evaluate actively managed portfolios., Higher information ratio portfolios can be used to create higher Sharpe ratio portfolios. The optimal amount of active management that maximizes a portfolio’s Sharpe ratio is positively related to the assumed forecasting accuracy or ex ante information coefficient of the active strategy., The active risk of an actively managed strategy can be adjusted to its desired level by combining it with a position in the benchmark. Furthermore, once an investor has identified the maximum Sharpe ratio portfolio, the total volatility of a portfolio can be adjusted to its desired level by combining it with cash (two-fund separation concept)., The fundamental law of active portfolio management began as a conceptual framework for evaluating the potential value added of various investment strategies, but it has also emerged as an operational system for measuring the essential components of those active strategies., Although the fundamental law provides a framework for analyzing investment strategies, the essential inputs of forecasted asset returns and risks still require judgment in formulating the expected returns., The fundamental law separates the expected value added, or portfolio return relative to the benchmark return, into the basic elements of the strategy: skill as measured by the information coefficient, structuring of the portfolio as measured by the transfer coefficient, breadth of the strategy measured by the number of independent decisions per year, and aggressiveness measured by the benchmark tracking risk. The last three of these four elements may be beyond the control of the investor if they are specified by investment policy or constrained by regulation., skill as measured by the information coefficient,, structuring of the portfolio as measured by the transfer coefficient,, breadth of the strategy measured by the number of independent decisions per year, and, aggressiveness measured by the benchmark tracking risk., The fundamental law has been applied in settings that include the selection of country equity markets in a global equity fund and the timing of credit and duration exposures in a fixed-income fund., The fundamental law of active management has limitations, including uncertainty about the ex ante information coefficient and the conceptual definition of breadth as the number of independent decisions by the investor.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2021/pdf/analysis-active-portfolio-management.pdf,
Asset Allocation with Real-World Constraints,2021 Curriculum,CFA Program Level III,Portfolio Management and Wealth Planning,"The member should be able to: discuss asset size, liquidity needs, time horizon, and regulatory or other considerations as constraints on asset allocation; discuss tax considerations in asset allocation and rebalancing; recommend and justify revisions to an asset allocation given change(s) in investment objectives and/or constraints; discuss the use of short-term shifts in asset allocation; identify behavioral biases that arise in asset allocation and recommend methods to overcome them.","The member should be able to: discuss asset size, liquidity needs, time horizon, and regulatory or other considerations as constraints on asset allocation; discuss tax considerations in asset allocation and rebalancing; recommend and justify revisions to an asset allocation given change(s) in investment objectives and/or constraints; discuss the use of short-term shifts in asset allocation; identify behavioral biases that arise in asset allocation and recommend methods to overcome them.","The primary constraints on an asset allocation decision are asset size, liquidity, time horizon, and other external considerations, such as taxes and regulation., The size of an asset owner’s portfolio may limit the asset classes accessible to the asset owner. An asset owner’s portfolio may be too small—or too large—to capture the returns of certain asset classes or strategies efficiently., Complex asset classes and investment vehicles require sufficient governance capacity., Large-scale asset owners may achieve operating efficiencies, but they may find it difficult to deploy capital effectively in certain active investment strategies given liquidity conditions and trading costs., Smaller portfolios may also be constrained by size. They may be too small to adequately diversify across the range of asset classes and investment managers, or they may have staffing constraints that prevent them from monitoring a complex investment program., Investors with smaller portfolios may be constrained in their ability to access private equity, private real estate, hedge funds, and infrastructure investments because of the high required minimum investments and regulatory restrictions associated with those asset classes. Wealthy families may pool assets to meet the required minimums., The liquidity needs of the asset owner and the liquidity characteristics of the asset classes each influence the available opportunity set., Liquidity needs must also take into consideration the financial strength of the investor and resources beyond those held in the investment portfolio., When assessing the appropriateness of any given asset class for a given investor, it is important to evaluate potential liquidity needs in the context of an extreme market stress event., An investor’s time horizon must be considered in any asset allocation exercise. Changes in human capital and the changing character of liabilities are two important time-related constraints of asset allocation., External considerations—such as regulations, tax rules, funding, and financing needs—are also likely to influence the asset allocation decision., Taxes alter the distribution of returns by both reducing the expected mean return and muting the dispersion of returns. Asset values and asset risk and return inputs to asset allocation should be modified to reflect the tax status of the investor. Correlation assumptions do not need to be adjusted, but taxes do affect the return and the standard deviation assumptions for each asset class., Periodic portfolio rebalancing to return the portfolio to its target strategic asset allocation is an integral part of sound portfolio management. Taxable investors must consider the tax implications of rebalancing., Rebalancing thresholds may be wider for taxable portfolios because it takes larger asset class movements to materially alter the risk profile of the taxable portfolio., Strategic asset location is the placement of less tax-efficient assets in accounts with more-favorable tax treatment., An asset owner’s strategic asset allocation should be re-examined periodically, even in the absence of a change in the asset owner’s circumstances., A special review of the asset allocation policy may be triggered by a change in goals, constraints, or beliefs., In some situations, a change to an asset allocation strategy may be implemented without a formal asset allocation study. Anticipating key milestones that would alter the asset owner’s risk appetite, and implementing pre-established changes to the asset allocation in response, is often referred to as a “glide path.”, Tactical asset allocation (TAA) allows short-term deviations from the strategic asset allocation (SAA) targets and are expected to increase risk-adjusted return. Using either short-term views or signals, the investor actively re-weights broad asset classes, sectors, or risk-factor premiums. The sizes of these deviations from the SAA are often constrained by the Investment Policy Statement., The success of TAA decisions is measured against the performance of the SAA policy portfolio by comparing Sharpe ratios, evaluating the information ratio or the t-statistic of the average excess return of the TAA portfolio relative to the SAA portfolio, or plotting outcomes versus the efficient frontier., TAA incurs trading and tax costs. Tactical trades can also increase the concentration of risk., Discretionary TAA relies on a qualitative interpretation of political, economic, and financial market conditions and is predicated on a belief of persistent manager skill in predicting and timing short-term market moves., Systematic TAA relies on quantitative signals to capture documented return anomalies that may be inconsistent with market efficiency., The behavioral biases most relevant in asset allocation include loss aversion, the illusion of control, mental accounting, recency bias, framing, and availability bias., An effective investment program will address behavioral biases through a formal asset allocation process with its own objective framework, governance, and controls., In goals-based investing, loss-aversion bias can be mitigated by framing risk in terms of shortfall probability or by funding high-priority goals with low-risk assets., The cognitive bias, illusion of control, and hindsight bias can all be mitigated by using a formal asset allocation process that uses long-term return and risk forecasts, optimization constraints anchored around asset class weights in the global market portfolio, and strict policy ranges., Goals-based investing incorporates the mental accounting bias directly into the asset allocation solution by aligning each goal with a discrete sub-portfolio., A formal asset allocation policy with pre-specified allowable ranges may constrain recency bias., The framing bias effect can be mitigated by presenting the possible asset allocation choices with multiple perspectives on the risk/reward trade-off., Familiarity bias, a form of availability bias, most commonly results in an overweight in home country securities and may also cause investors to inappropriately compare their investment decisions (and performance) to other organizations. Familiarity bias can be mitigated by using the global market portfolio as the starting point in developing the asset allocation and by carefully evaluating any potential deviations from this baseline portfolio., A strong governance framework with the appropriate level of expertise and well-documented investment beliefs increases the likelihood that shifts in asset allocation are made objectively and in accordance with those beliefs. This will help to mitigate the effect that behavioral biases may have on the long-term success of the investment program.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2021/pdf/asset-allocation-real-world-constraints.pdf,

Trend changes arising from exogenous shocks are impossible to forecast and difficult to identify, assess, and quantify until the change is well established., Among the most important sources of shocks are policy changes, new products and technologies, geopolitics, natural disasters, natural resources/critical inputs, and financial crises., An economy’s aggregate trend growth rate reflects growth in labor inputs and growth in labor productivity. Extrapolating past trends in these components can provide a reasonable initial estimate of the future growth trend, which can be adjusted based on observable information. Less developed economies may require more significant adjustments because they are likely to be undergoing more rapid structural changes., The average level of real (nominal) default-free bond yields is linked to the trend rate of real (nominal) growth. The trend rate of growth provides an important anchor for estimating bond returns over horizons long enough for this reversion to prevail over cyclical and short-term forces., The trend growth rate provides an anchor for long-run equity appreciation. In the very long run, the aggregate value of equity must grow at a rate very close to the rate of GDP growth., There are three main approaches to economic forecasting: Econometric models: structural and reduced-form statistical models of key variables generate quantitative estimates, impose discipline on forecasts, may be robust enough to approximate reality, and can readily forecast the impact of exogenous variables or shocks. However, they tend to be complex, time-consuming to formulate, and potentially mis-specified, and they rarely forecast turning points well. Indicators: variables that lead, lag, or coincide with turns in the economy. This approach is the simplest, requiring only a limited number of published statistics. It can generate false signals, however, and is vulnerable to revisions that may overfit past data at the expense of the reliability of out-of-sample forecasts. Checklist(s): subjective integration of information deemed relevant by the analyst. This approach is the most flexible but also the most subjective. It readily adapts to a changing environment, but ongoing collection and assessment of information make it time-consuming and also limit the depth and consistency of the analysis., Econometric models: structural and reduced-form statistical models of key variables generate quantitative estimates, impose discipline on forecasts, may be robust enough to approximate reality, and can readily forecast the impact of exogenous variables or shocks.

This approach is the most flexible but also the most subjective. It readily adapts to a changing environment, but ongoing collection and assessment of information make it time-consuming and also limit the depth and consistency of the analysis., The business cycle is the result of many intermediate frequency cycles that jointly generate most of the variation in aggregate economic activity. This explains why historical business cycles have varied in both duration and intensity and why it is difficult to project turning points in real time., The business cycle reflects decisions that (a) are made based on imperfect information and/or analysis with the expectation of future benefits, (b) require significant current resources and/or time to implement, and (c) are difficult and/or costly to reverse. Such decisions are, broadly defined, investment decisions., A typical business cycle has a number of phases. We split the cycle into five phases with the following capital market implications: Initial Recovery. Short-term interest rates and bond yields are low. Bond yields are likely to bottom. Stock markets may rise strongly. Cyclical/riskier assets such as small stocks, high-yield bonds, and emerging market securities perform well. Early Expansion. Short rates are moving up. Longer-maturity bond yields are stable or rising slightly. Stocks are trending up. Late Expansion. Interest rates rise, and the yield curve flattens. Stock markets often rise but may be volatile. Cyclical assets may underperform while inflation hedges outperform. Slowdown. Short-term interest rates are at or nearing a peak. Government bond yields peak and may then decline sharply. The yield curve may invert. Credit spreads widen, especially for weaker credits. Stocks may fall. Interest-sensitive stocks and “quality” stocks with stable earnings perform best. Contraction. Interest rates and bond yields drop. The yield curve steepens. The stock market drops initially but usually starts to rise well before the recovery emerges. Credit spreads widen and remain elevated until clear signs of a cycle trough emerge., Initial Recovery. Short-term interest rates and bond yields are low. Bond yields are likely to bottom.

Interest rates and bond yields drop. The yield curve steepens. The stock market drops initially but usually starts to rise well before the recovery emerges. Credit spreads widen and remain elevated until clear signs of a cycle trough emerge., At least three factors complicate translation of business cycle information into capital market expectations and profitable investment decisions. First, the phases of the cycle vary in length and amplitude. Second, it is not always easy to distinguish between cyclical forces and secular forces acting on the economy and the markets. Third, how, when, and by how much the markets respond to the business cycle is as uncertain as the cycle itself—perhaps more so., Business cycle information is likely to be most reliable/valuable in setting capital market expectations over horizons within the range of likely expansion and contraction phases. Transitory developments cloud shorter-term forecasts, whereas significantly longer horizons likely cover portions of multiple cycle phases. Information about the current cyclical state of the economy has no predictive value over very long horizons., Monetary policy is often used as a mechanism for intervention in the business cycle. This mechanism is inherent in the mandates of most central banks to maintain price stability and/or growth consistent with potential., Monetary policy aims to be countercyclical, but the ability to fine-tune the economy is limited and policy measures may exacerbate rather than moderate the business cycle. This risk is greatest at the top of the cycle when the central bank may overestimate the economy’s momentum and/or underestimate the potency of restrictive policies., Fiscal policy—government spending and taxation—can be used to counteract cyclical fluctuations in the economy. Aside from extreme situations, however, fiscal policy typically addresses objectives other than regulating short-term growth. So-called automatic stabilizers do play an important role in mitigating cyclical fluctuations., The Taylor Rule is a useful tool for assessing a central bank’s stance and for predicting how that stance is likely to evolve., The expectation that central banks could not implement negative policy rates proved to be unfounded in the aftermath of the 2007–2009 global financial crisis. Because major central banks combined negative policy rates with other extraordinary measures (notably quantitative easing), however, the effectiveness of the negative rate policy is unclear. The effectiveness of quantitative easing is also unclear., Negative interest rates, and the environment that gives rises to them, make the task of setting capital market expectations even more complex. Among the issues that arise are the following: It is difficult to justify negative rates as a “risk-free rate” to which risk premiums can be added to establish long-term “equilibrium” asset class returns. Historical data and quantitative models are even less likely to be reliable. Market relationships (e.g., the yield curve) are likely to be distorted by other concurrent policy measures., It is difficult to justify negative rates as a “risk-free rate” to which risk premiums can be added to establish long-term “equilibrium” asset class returns., Historical data and quantitative models are even less likely to be reliable., Market relationships (e.g., the yield curve) are likely to be distorted by other concurrent policy measures., The mix of monetary and fiscal policies has its most apparent effect on the average level of interest rates and inflation. Persistently loose (tight) fiscal policy increases (reduces) the average level of real interest rates. Persistently loose (tight) monetary policy increases (reduces) the average levels of actual and expected inflation. The impact on nominal rates is ambiguous if one policy is persistently tight and the other persistently loose., Changes in the slope of the yield curve are driven primarily by the evolution of short rate expectations, which are driven mainly by the business cycle and policies. The slope of the curve may also be affected by debt management., The slope of the yield curve is useful as a predictor of economic growth and as an indicator of where the economy is in the business cycle., Macroeconomic linkages between countries are expressed through their respective current and capital accounts., There are four primary mechanisms by which the current and capital accounts are kept in balance: changes in income (GDP), relative prices, interest rates and asset prices, and exchange rates., In the short run, interest rates, exchange rates, and financial asset prices must adjust to keep the capital account in balance with the more slowly evolving current account. The current account, in conjunction with real output and the relative prices of goods and services, tends to reflect secular trends and the pace of the business cycle., Interest rates and currency exchange rates are inextricably linked. This relationship is evident in the fact that a country cannot simultaneously allow unfettered capital flows, maintain a fixed exchange rate, and pursue an independent monetary policy., Two countries will share a default-free yield curve if (and only if) there is perfect capital mobility and the exchange rate is credibility fixed forever. It is the lack of credibly fixed exchange rates that allows (default-free) yield curves, and hence bond returns, to be less than perfectly correlated across markets., With floating exchange rates, the link between interest rates and exchange rates is primarily expectational. To equalize risk-adjusted expected returns across markets, interest rates must be higher (lower) in a currency that is expected to depreciate (appreciate). This dynamic can lead to the exchange rate “overshooting” in one direction to generate the expectation of movement in the opposite direction., An investor cares about the real return that he or she expects to earn in his or her own currency. In terms of a foreign asset, what matters is the nominal return and the change in the exchange rate., Although real interest rates around the world need not be equal, they are linked through the requirement that global savings must always equal global investment. Hence, they will tend to move together.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2021/pdf/capital-market-expectations-framework-macro.pdf,

discuss methods of forecasting volatility; recommend and justify changes in the component weights of a global investment portfolio based on trends and expected changes in macroeconomic factors.,"The choice among forecasting techniques is effectively a choice of the information on which forecasts will be conditioned and how that information will be incorporated into the forecasts., The formal forecasting tools most commonly used in forecasting capital market returns fall into three broad categories: statistical methods, discounted cash flow models, and risk premium models., Sample statistics, especially the sample mean, are subject to substantial estimation error., Shrinkage estimation combines two estimates (or sets of estimates) into a more precise estimate., Time-series estimators, which explicitly incorporate dynamics, may summarize historical data well without providing insight into the underlying drivers of forecasts., Discounted cash flow models are used to estimate the required return implied by an asset’s current price., The risk premium approach expresses expected return as the sum of the risk-free rate of interest and one or more risk premiums., There are three methods for modeling risk premiums: equilibrium models, such as the CAPM; factor models; and building blocks., The DCF method is the only one that is precise enough to use in support of trades involving individual fixed-income securities., There are three main methods for developing expected returns for fixed-income asset classes: DCF, building blocks, and inclusion in an equilibrium model., As a forecast of bond return, YTM, the most commonly quoted metric, can be improved by incorporating the impact of yield changes on reinvestment of cash flows and valuation at the investment horizon., The building blocks for fixed-income expected returns are the short-term default-free rate, the term premium, the credit premium, and the liquidity premium., Term premiums are roughly proportional to duration, whereas credit premiums tend to be larger at the short end of the curve., Both term premiums and credit premiums are positively related to the slope of the yield curve., Credit spreads reflect both the credit premium (i.e., additional expected return) and expected losses due to default., A baseline estimate of the liquidity premium can be based on the yield spread between the highest-quality issuer in a market (usually the sovereign) and the next highest-quality large issuer (often a government agency)., Emerging market debt exposes investors to heightened risk with respect to both ability to pay and willingness to pay, which can be associated with the economy and political/legal weaknesses, respectively., The Grinold–Kroner model decomposes the expected return on equities into three components: (1) expected cash flow return, composed of the dividend yield minus the rate of change in shares outstanding, (2) expected return due to nominal earnings growth, and (3) expected repricing return, reflecting the rate of change in the P/E., Forecasting the equity premium directly is just as difficult as projecting the absolute level of equity returns, so the building block approach provides little, if any, specific insight with which to improve equity return forecasts., The Singer–Terhaar version of the international capital asset pricing model combines a global CAPM equilibrium that assumes full market integration with expected returns for each asset class based on complete segmentation., Emerging market equities expose investors to the same underlying risks as emerging market debt does: more fragile economies, less stable political and policy frameworks, and weaker legal protections., Emerging market investors need to pay particular attention to the ways in which the value of their ownership claims might be expropriated. Among the areas of concern are standards of corporate governance, accounting and disclosure standards, property rights laws, and checks and balances on governmental actions., Historical return data for real estate is subject to substantial smoothing, which biases standard volatility estimates downward and distorts correlations with other asset classes. Meaningful analysis of real estate as an asset class requires explicit handling of this data issue., Real estate is subject to boom–bust cycles that both drive and are driven by the business cycle., The cap rate, defined as net operating income in the current period divided by the property value, is the standard valuation metric for commercial real estate., A model similar to the Grinold–Kroner model can be applied to estimate the expected return on real estate: E(Rre ) = Cap rate + NOI growth rate − %ΔCap rate., There is a clear pattern of higher cap rates for riskier property types, lower-quality properties, and less attractive locations., Real estate expected returns contain all the standard building block risk premiums: Term premium: As a very long-lived asset with relatively stable cash flows, income-producing real estate has a high duration. Credit premium: A fixed-term lease is like a corporate bond issued by the leaseholder and secured by the property. Equity premium: Owners bear the risk of property value fluctuations, as well as risk associated with rent growth, lease renewal, and vacancies. Liquidity premium: Real estate trades infrequently and is costly to transact., Term premium: As a very long-lived asset with relatively stable cash flows, income-producing real estate has a high duration., Credit premium: A fixed-term lease is like a corporate bond issued by the leaseholder and secured by the property., Equity premium: Owners bear the risk of property value fluctuations, as well as risk associated with rent growth, lease renewal, and vacancies., Liquidity premium: Real estate trades infrequently and is costly to transact., Currency exchange rates are especially difficult to forecast because they are tied to governments, financial systems, legal systems, and geographies. Forecasting exchange rates requires identification and assessment of the forces that are likely to exert the most influence., Provided they can be financed, trade flows do not usually exert a significant impact on exchange rates. International capital flows are typically larger and more volatile than trade-financing flows., PPP is a poor predictor of exchange rate movements over short to intermediate horizons but is a better guide to currency movements over progressively longer multi-year horizons., The extent to which the current account balance influences the exchange rate depends primarily on whether it is likely to be persistent and, if so, whether it can be sustained., Capital seeks the highest risk-adjusted expected return. In a world of perfect capital mobility, in the long run, the exchange rate will be driven to the point at which the expected percentage change equals the “excess” risk-adjusted expected return on the portfolio of assets denominated in the domestic currency over that of the portfolio of assets denominated in the foreign currency. However, in the short run, there can be an exchange rate overshoot in the opposite direction as hot money chases higher returns., Carry trades are profitable on average, which is contrary to the predictions of uncovered interest rate parity., Each country/currency has a unique portfolio of assets that makes up part of the global “market portfolio.” Exchange rates provide an across-the-board mechanism for adjusting the relative sizes of these portfolios to match investors’ desire to hold them., The portfolio balance perspective implies that exchange rates adjust in response to changes in the relative sizes and compositions of the aggregate portfolios denominated in each currency., The sample variance–covariance matrix is an unbiased estimate of the true VCV structure; that is, it will be correct on average., There are two main problems with using the sample VCV matrix as an estimate/forecast of the true VCV matrix: It cannot be used for large numbers of asset classes, and it is subject to substantial sampling error., Linear factor models impose structure on the VCV matrix that allows them to handle very large numbers of asset classes. The drawback is that the VCV matrix is biased and inconsistent unless the assumed structure is true., Shrinkage estimation of the VCV matrix is a weighted average of the sample VCV matrix and a target VCV matrix that reflects assumed “prior” knowledge of the true VCV structure., Failure to adjust for the impact of smoothing in observed return data for real estate and other private assets will almost certainly lead to distorted portfolio analysis and hence poor asset allocation decisions., Financial asset returns exhibit volatility clustering, evidenced by periods of high and low volatilities. ARCH models were developed to address these time-varying volatilities., One of the simplest and most used ARCH models represents today’s variance as a linear combination of yesterday’s variance and a new “shock” to volatility. With appropriate parameter values, the model exhibits the volatility clustering characteristic of financial asset returns.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2021/pdf/capital-markets-expectations-asset-class-returns.pdf,

Without a full understanding of the client’s situation and requirements, it is unlikely that successful results will be achieved., The IPS can take a variety of forms. A typical format will include the client’s investment objectives and also list the constraints that apply to the client’s portfolio., The client’s objectives are specified in terms of risk tolerance and return requirements., The constraints section covers factors that need to be considered when constructing a portfolio for the client that meets the objectives. The typical constraint categories are liquidity requirements, time horizon, regulatory requirements, tax status, and unique needs., Clients may have personal objections to certain products or practices, which could lead to the exclusion of certain companies, countries, or types of securities from the investable universe as well as the client’s benchmark. Such considerations are often referred to as ESG (environmental, social, governance)., ESG considerations can be integrated into an investment policy by exclusionary screening, best-in-class selection, active ownership, thematic and impact investing and ESG integration in security analysis., Risk objectives are specifications for portfolio risk that reflect the risk tolerance of the client. Quantitative risk objectives can be absolute or relative or a combination of the two., The client’s overall risk tolerance is a function of the client’s ability to accept risk and their “risk attitude,” which can be considered the client’s willingness to take risk., The client’s return objectives can be stated on an absolute or a relative basis. As an example of an absolute objective, the client may want to achieve a particular percentage rate of return. Alternatively, the return objective can be stated on a relative basis, for example, relative to a benchmark return., The liquidity section of the IPS should state what the client’s requirements are to draw cash from the portfolio., The time horizon section of the IPS should state the time horizon over which the investor is investing. This horizon may be the period during which the portfolio is accumulating before any assets need to be withdrawn., Tax status varies among investors and a client’s tax status should be stated in the IPS., The IPS should state any legal or regulatory restrictions that constrain the investment of the portfolio., The unique circumstances section of the IPS should cover any other aspect of a client’s circumstances that is likely to have a material impact on the composition of the portfolio. Certain ESG implementation approaches, such as negative (exclusionary) screening, best-in-class, thematic investing, impact investing, and ESG integration may be discussed in this section., Asset classes are the building blocks of an asset allocation. An asset class is a category of assets that have similar characteristics, attributes, and risk/return relationships. Traditionally, investors have distinguished cash, equities, bonds, and real estate as the major asset classes., A strategic asset allocation results from combining the constraints and objectives articulated in the IPS and capital market expectations regarding the asset classes., As time goes on, a client’s asset allocation will drift from the target allocation, and the amount of allowable drift as well as a rebalancing policy should be formalized., In addition to taking systematic risk, an investment committee may choose to take tactical asset allocation risk or security selection risk. The amount of return attributable to these decisions can be measured., ESG considerations may be integrated into the portfolio planning and construction process. Such considerations can be difficult given that ESG data is often not required to be disclosed by companies. ESG implementation approaches require a set of instructions for investment managers with regards to the selection of securities, the exercise of shareholder rights and the selection of investment strategies.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2021/pdf/basics-portfolio-planning-construction.pdf,
The Behavioral Biases of Individuals,2021 Curriculum,CFA Program Level III,Portfolio Management and Wealth Planning,The member should be able to: distinguish between cognitive errors and emotional biases; discuss commonly recognized behavioral biases and their implications for financial decision making; identify and evaluate an individual’s behavioral biases;,The member should be able to: distinguish between cognitive errors and emotional biases; discuss commonly recognized behavioral biases and their implications for financial decision making; identify and evaluate an individual’s behavioral biases;,"Individuals do not necessarily act rationally and consider all available information in the decision-making process because they may be influenced by behavioral biases., Biases may lead to sub-optimal decisions., Behavioral biases may be categorized as either cognitive errors or emotional biases. A single bias may, however, have aspects of both with one type of bias dominating., Cognitive errors stem from basic statistical, information-processing, or memory errors; cognitive errors typically result from faulty reasoning., Emotional biases stem from impulse or intuition; emotional biases tend to result from reasoning influenced by feelings., Cognitive errors are more easily corrected for because they stem from faulty reasoning rather than an emotional predisposition., Emotional biases are harder to correct for because they are based on feelings, which can be difficult to change., To adapt to a bias is to recognize and accept the bias and to adjust for the bias rather than to attempt to moderate the bias., To moderate a bias is to recognize the bias and to attempt to reduce or even eliminate the bias within the individual., Cognitive errors can be further classified into two categories: belief perseverance biases and information-processing biases., Belief perseverance errors reflect an inclination to maintain beliefs. The belief is maintained by committing statistical, information-processing, or memory errors. Belief perseverance biases are closely related to the psychological concept of cognitive dissonance., Belief perseverance biases include conservatism, confirmation, representativeness, illusion of control, and hindsight., Information-processing biases result in information being processed and used illogically or irrationally., Information-processing biases include anchoring and adjustment, mental accounting, framing, and availability., Emotional biases include loss aversion, overconfidence, self-control, status quo, endowment, and regret aversion., Understanding and detecting biases is the first step in overcoming the effect of biases on financial decisions. By understanding behavioral biases, financial market participants may be able to moderate or adapt to the biases and as a result improve upon economic outcomes.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2021/pdf/behavioral-biases-individuals.pdf,

In general, the values of their assets are relatively close to fair market values., A widely used approach to analyzing a bank, CAMELS, considers a bank’s Capital adequacy, Asset quality, Management capabilities, Earnings sufficiency, Liquidity position, and Sensitivity to market risk., “Capital adequacy,” described in terms of the proportion of the bank’s assets that is funded with capital, indicates that a bank has enough capital to absorb potential losses without severely damaging its financial position., “Asset quality” includes the concept of quality of the bank’s assets—credit quality and diversification—and the concept of overall sound risk management., “Management capabilities” refers to the bank management’s ability to identify and exploit appropriate business opportunities and to simultaneously manage associated risks., “Earnings” refers to the bank’s return on capital relative to cost of capital and also includes the concept of earnings quality., “Liquidity” refers to the amount of liquid assets held by the bank relative to its near-term expected cash flows. Under Basel III, liquidity also refers to the stability of the bank’s funding sources., “Sensitivity to market risk” pertains to how adverse changes in markets (including interest rate, exchange rate, equity, and commodity markets) could affect the bank’s earnings and capital position., In addition to the CAMELS components, important attributes deserving analysts’ attention include government support, the banking entity’s mission, corporate culture and competitive environment, off-balance-sheet items, segment information, currency exposure, and risk disclosures., Insurance companies are typically categorized as property and casualty (P&C) or life and health (L&H)., Insurance companies earn revenues from premiums (amounts paid by the purchaser of insurance products) and from investment income earned on the float (amounts collected as premiums and not yet paid out as benefits)., P&C insurers’ policies are usually short term, and the final cost will usually be known within a year of a covered event, whereas L&H insurers’ policies are usually longer term.

The objective function of a systematic manager will be specified explicitly, whereas that of a discretionary manager may be set implicitly., Risk budgeting is a process by which the total risk appetite of the portfolio is allocated among the various components of portfolio choice., Active risk (tracking error) is a function of the portfolio’s exposure to systematic risks and the level of idiosyncratic, security-specific risk. It is a relevant risk measure for benchmark-relative portfolios., Absolute risk is the total volatility of portfolio returns independent of a benchmark. It is the most appropriate risk measure for portfolios with an absolute return objective., Active Share measures the extent to which the number and sizing of positions in a manager’s portfolio differ from the benchmark., Benchmark-agnostic managers usually have a greater level of Active Share and most likely have a greater level of active risk., An effective risk management process requires that the portfolio manager determine which type of risk measure is most appropriate, understand how each aspect of the strategy contributes to its overall risk, determine what level of risk budget is appropriate, and effectively allocate risk among individual positions/factors., determine which type of risk measure is most appropriate,, understand how each aspect of the strategy contributes to its overall risk,, determine what level of risk budget is appropriate, and, effectively allocate risk among individual positions/factors., Risk constraints may be either formal or heuristic. Heuristic constraints may impose limits on concentration by security, sector, industry, or geography; net exposures to risk factors, such as Beta, Size, Value, and Momentum; net exposures to currencies; the degree of leverage; the degree of illiquidity; exposures to reputational/environmental risks, such as carbon emissions; and other attributes related to an investor’s core concerns., concentration by security, sector, industry, or geography;, net exposures to risk factors, such as Beta, Size, Value, and Momentum;, net exposures to currencies;, the degree of leverage;, the degree of illiquidity;, exposures to reputational/environmental risks, such as carbon emissions; and, other attributes related to an investor’s core concerns., Formal risk constraints are statistical in nature. Formal risk measures include the following: Volatility—the standard deviation of portfolio returns Active risk—also called tracking error or tracking risk Skewness—a measure of the degree to which return expectations are non-normally distributed Drawdown—a measure of portfolio loss from its high point until it begins to recover Value at risk (VaR)—the minimum loss that would be expected a certain percentage of the time over a certain period of time given the modeled market conditions, typically expressed as the minimum loss that can be expected to occur 5% of the time CVaR (expected tail loss or expected shortfall)—the average loss that would be incurred if the VaR cutoff is exceeded IVaR—the change in portfolio VaR when adding a new position to a portfolio MVaR—the effect on portfolio risk of a change in the position size.

Implicit costs include delay and slippage., The costs of managing assets may affect the investment strategy and the portfolio construction process. Slippage costs are significantly greater for smaller-cap securities and during periods of high volatility. A strategy that demands immediate execution is likely to incur higher market impact costs.

By considering behavioral biases, it is possible to moderate their effects., All market participants, even those with significant knowledge of and experience in finance, may exhibit behavioral biases. Analysts are not immune. Analysts, in general, are prone to overconfidence, representativeness, availability, illusion of control, and hindsight biases. Awareness of their biases and their potential influences can help analysts put in place measures to help moderate the effect of these biases., Analysts interpreting information provided by management should consider and adjust for the biases that analysts and management teams are typically susceptible to, including framing, anchoring and adjustment, availability, and overconfidence. Management biases can affect both the choice of information presented and how it is presented. These may have an effect on the analysis., Committees often have the responsibility for making investment decisions and are subject to behavioral biases. It is important to implement procedures to alleviate the effect of behavioral biases and improve committee decision making., Behavioral finance has the potential to explain some apparent deviations from market efficiency (market anomalies).",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2021/pdf/behavioral-finance-investment-processes.pdf,

Fundamental approaches stress the use of human judgment in arriving at an investment decision, whereas quantitative approaches stress the use of rules-based, quantitative models to arrive at a decision., The main differences between fundamental and quantitative approaches include the following characteristics: approach to the decision-making process (subjective versus objective); forecast focus (stock returns versus factor returns); information used (research versus data); focus of the analysis (depth versus breadth); orientation to the data (forward looking versus backward looking); and approach to portfolio risk (emphasis on judgment versus emphasis on optimization techniques)., The main types of active management strategies include bottom-up, top-down, factor-based, and activist., Bottom-up strategies begin at the company level, and use company and industry analyses to assess the intrinsic value of the company and determine whether the stock is undervalued or overvalued relative to its market price., Fundamental managers often focus on one or more of the following company and industry characteristics: business model and branding, competitive advantages, and management and corporate governance., Bottom-up strategies are often divided into value-based approaches and growth-based approaches., Top-down strategies focus on the macroeconomic environment, demographic trends, and government policies to arrive at investment decisions., Top-down strategies are used in several investment decision processes, including the following: country and geographic allocation, sector and industry rotation, equity style rotation, volatility-based strategies, and thematic investment strategies., Quantitative equity investment strategies often use factor-based models. A factor-based strategy aims to identify significant factors that drive stock prices and to construct a portfolio with a positive bias towards such factors., Factors can be grouped based on fundamental characteristics—such as value, growth, and price momentum—or on unconventional data., Activist investors specialize in taking meaningful stakes in listed companies and influencing those companies to make changes to their management, strategy, or capital structures for the purpose of increasing the stock’s value and realizing a gain on their investment., Statistical arbitrage (or “stat arb”) strategies use statistical and technical analysis to exploit pricing anomalies and achieve superior returns. Pairs trading is an example of a popular and simple statistical arbitrage strategy., Event-driven strategies exploit market inefficiencies that may occur around corporate events such as mergers and acquisitions, earnings announcements, bankruptcies, share buybacks, special dividends, and spinoffs., The fundamental active investment process includes the following steps: define the investment universe; prescreen the universe; understand the industry and business; forecast the company’s financial performance; convert forecasts into a target price; construct the portfolio with the desired risk profile; and rebalance the portfolio according to a buy and sell discipline., Pitfalls in fundamental investing include behavioral biases, the value trap, and the growth trap., Behavioral biases can be divided into two groups: cognitive errors and emotional biases. Typical biases that are relevant to active equity management include confirmation bias, illusion of control, availability bias, loss aversion, overconfidence, and regret aversion., The quantitative active investment process includes the following steps: define the investment thesis; acquire, clean, and process the data; backtest the strategy; evaluate the strategy; and construct an efficient portfolio using risk and trading cost models., The pitfalls in quantitative investing include look-ahead and survivorship biases, overfitting, data mining, unrealistic turnover assumptions, transaction costs, and short availability., An investment style generally splits the stock universe into two or three groups, such that each group contains stocks with similar characteristics. The common style characteristics used in active management include value, size, price momentum, volatility, high dividend, and earnings quality. A stock’s membership in an industry, sector, or country group is also used to classify the investment style., Two main approaches are often used in style analysis: a returns-based approach and a holdings-based approach. Holdings-based approaches aggregate the style scores of individual holdings, while returns-based approaches analyze the investment style of portfolio managers by comparing the returns of the strategy to those of a set of style indexes.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2021/pdf/active-equity-investing-strategies.pdf,

By projecting profit margins or expenses and the level of investment in working and fixed capital needed to support projected sales, the analyst can forecast net income and cash flow., Projections of future performance are needed for discounted cash flow valuation of equity and are often needed in credit analysis to assess a borrower’s ability to repay interest and principal of a debt obligation., Credit analysis uses financial statement analysis to evaluate credit-relevant factors, including tolerance for leverage, operational stability, and margin stability., When ratios constructed from financial statement data and market data are used to screen for potential equity investments, fundamental decisions include which metrics to use as screens, how many metrics to include, what values of those metrics to use as cutoff points, and what weighting to give each metric., Analyst adjustments to a company’s reported financial statements are sometimes necessary (e.g., when comparing companies that use different accounting methods or assumptions).

An investment in alternatives typically fulfills one or more of four roles in an investor’s portfolio: capital growth, income generation, risk diversification, and/or safety., Private equity investments are generally viewed as return enhancers in a portfolio of traditional assets., Long/short equity strategies are generally believed to deliver equity-like returns with less than full exposure to the equity premium. Short-biased equity strategies are expected to lower a portfolio’s overall equity beta while producing some measure of alpha. Arbitrage and event-driven strategies are expected to provide equity-like returns with little to no correlation with traditional asset classes., Real assets (e.g., commodities, farmland, timber, energy, and infrastructure assets) are generally perceived to provide a hedge against inflation., Timber investments provide both growth and inflation-hedging properties., Commodities (e.g., metals, energy, livestock, and agricultural commodities) serve as a hedge against inflation and provide a differentiated source of alpha. Certain commodity investments serve as safe havens in times of crisis., Farmland investing may have a commodity-like profile or a commercial real-estate-like profile., Energy investments are generally considered a real asset as the investor owns the mineral rights to commodities that are correlated with inflation factors., Infrastructure investments tend to generate stable/modestly growing income and to have high correlation with overall inflation., Real estate strategies range from core to opportunistic and are believed to provide protection against unanticipated increases in inflation. Core real estate strategies are more income-oriented, while opportunistic strategies rely more heavily on capital appreciation., Bonds have been a more effective volatility mitigator than alternatives over shorter time horizons., The traditional approaches to defining asset classes are easy to communicate and implement. However, they tend to over-estimate portfolio diversification and obscure primary drivers of risk., Typical risk factors applied to alternative investments include equity, size, value, liquidity, duration, inflation, credit spread, and currency. A benefit of the risk factor approach is that every asset class can be described using the same framework., Risk factor-based approaches have certain limitations. A framework with too many factors is difficult to administer and interpret, but too small a set of risk factors may not accurately describe the characteristics of alternative asset classes. Risk factor sensitivities are highly sensitive to the historical look-back period., Investors with less than a 15-year investment horizon should generally avoid investments in private real estate, private real asset, and private equity funds., Investors must consider whether they have the necessary skills, expertise, and resources to build an alternative investment program internally. Investors without a strong governance program are less likely to develop a successful alternative investment program., Reporting for alternative funds is often less transparent than investors are accustomed to seeing on their stock and bond portfolios. For many illiquid strategies, reporting is often received well past typical monthly or quarter-end deadlines. Full, position-level transparency is rare in many alternative strategies., Three primary approaches are used to determine the desired allocation to the alternative asset classes: Monte Carlo simulation may be used to generate return scenarios that relax the assumption of normally distributed returns. Optimization techniques, which incorporate downside risk or take into account skew, may be used to enhance the asset allocation process. Risk factor-based approaches to alternative asset allocation can be applied to develop more robust asset allocation proposals., Monte Carlo simulation may be used to generate return scenarios that relax the assumption of normally distributed returns., Optimization techniques, which incorporate downside risk or take into account skew, may be used to enhance the asset allocation process., Risk factor-based approaches to alternative asset allocation can be applied to develop more robust asset allocation proposals., Two key analytical challenges in modelling allocations to alternatives include stale and/or artificially smoothed returns and return distributions that exhibit significant skewness and fat tails (or excess kurtosis)., Artificially smoothed returns can be detected by testing the return stream for serial correlation. The analyst needs to unsmooth the returns to get a more accurate representation of the risk and return characteristics of the asset class., Skewness and kurtosis can be dealt with by using empirically observed asset returns because they incorporate the actual distribution. Advanced mathematical or statistical models can also be used to capture the true behavior of alternative asset classes., Applications of Monte Carlo simulation in allocating to alternative investments include: simulating skewed and fat-tailed financial variables by estimating the behavior of factors and/or assets in low-volatility regimes and high-volatility regimes, then generating scenarios using the different means and covariances estimated under the different regimes; and simulating portfolio outcomes (+/− 1 standard deviation) to estimate the likelihood of falling short of the investment objectives., simulating skewed and fat-tailed financial variables by estimating the behavior of factors and/or assets in low-volatility regimes and high-volatility regimes, then generating scenarios using the different means and covariances estimated under the different regimes; and, simulating portfolio outcomes (+/− 1 standard deviation) to estimate the likelihood of falling short of the investment objectives., Unconstrained mean–variance optimization (MVO) often leads to portfolios dominated by cash and fixed income at the low-risk end of the spectrum and by private equity at the high-risk end of the spectrum. Some investors impose minimum and maximum constraints on asset classes. Slight changes in the input variables could lead to substantial changes in the asset allocations., Mean–CVaR optimization may be used to identify allocations that minimize downside risk rather than simply volatility., Investors may choose to optimize allocations to risk factors rather than asset classes. These allocations, however, must be implemented using asset classes. Portfolios with similar risk factor exposures can have vastly different asset allocations., Some caveats with respect to risk factor-based allocations are that investors may hold different definitions for a given risk factor, correlations among risk factors may shift under changing market conditions, and some factor sensitivities are very unstable., Cash flow and commitment-pacing models enable investors in private alternatives to better manage their portfolio liquidity and set realistic annual commitment targets to reach the desired asset allocation., An alternative investment program should be monitored relative to the goals established for the alternative investment program, not simply relative to a benchmark. The investor must monitor developments in the relevant markets to ensure that the fundamental thesis underlying the decision to invest remains intact., Two common benchmarking approaches to benchmarking alternative investments—custom index proxies and peer group comparisons—have significant limitations., IRRs are sensitive to the timing of cash flows into and out of the fund: Two managers may have similar portfolios but different return profiles depending on their capital call and distribution schedule., Pricing issues can distort reported returns and the associated risk metrics, such as betas, correlations, and Sharpe ratios., Monitoring of the firm and the investment process are particularly important in alternative investment structures where the manager cannot be terminated easily. Key elements to monitor include key person risk, alignment of interests, style drift, risk management, client/asset turnover, client profile, and service providers.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2021/pdf/asset-allocation-alternative-investments.pdf,

Thus, rolling window backtesting is a proxy for actual investing., There are two commonly used approaches in backtesting—long/short hedged portfolio and Spearman rank IC. The two approaches often give similar results, but results can be quite different at times. Choosing the right approach depends on the model building and portfolio construction process., In assessing backtesting results, in addition to traditional performance measurements (e.g., Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown), analysts need to take into account data coverage, return distribution, factor efficacy, factor turnover, and decay., There are several behavioral issues in backtesting to which analysts need to pay particular attention, including survivorship bias and look-ahead bias., Risk parity is a popular portfolio construction technique that takes into account the volatility of each factor (or asset) and the correlations of returns between all factors (or assets) to be combined in the portfolio. The objective is for each factor (or asset) to make an equal (hence “parity”) risk contribution to the overall or targeted risk of the portfolio., Asset (and factor) returns are often negatively skewed and exhibit excess kurtosis (fat tails) and tail dependence compared with normal distribution. As a result, standard rolling window backtesting may not be able to fully account for the randomness in asset returns, particularly on downside risk., Financial data often face structural breaks. Scenario analysis can help investors understand the performance of an investment strategy in different structural regimes., Historical simulation is relatively straightforward to perform but shares pros and cons similar to those of rolling window backtesting. For example, a key assumption these methods share is that the distribution pattern from the historical data is sufficient to represent the uncertainty in the future. Bootstrapping (or random draws with replacement) is often used in historical simulation., Monte Carlo simulation is a more sophisticated technique than historical simulation is. In Monte Carlo simulation, the most important decision is the choice of functional form of the statistical distribution of decision variables/return drivers. Multivariate normal distribution is often used in investment research, owing to its simplicity. However, a multivariate normal distribution cannot account for negative skewness and fat tails observed in factor and asset returns., The Monte Carlo simulation technique makes use of the inverse transformation method—the process of converting a randomly generated uniformly distributed number into a simulated value of a random variable of a desired distribution., Sensitivity analysis, a technique for exploring how a target variable and risk profiles are affected by changes in input variables, can further help investors understand the limitations of conventional Monte Carlo simulation (which typically assumes a multivariate normal distribution as a starting point). A multivariate skewed t-distribution takes into account skewness and kurtosis but requires estimation of more parameters and thus is more likely to suffer from larger estimation errors.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2021/pdf/backtesting-and-simulation.pdf,

The reading is organized around a classification of active equity strategies into two broad approaches: fundamental and quantitative. Both approaches aim at outperforming a passive benchmark (for example, a broad equity market index), but they tend to make investment decisions differently. Fundamental approaches stress the use of human judgment in processing information and making investment decisions, whereas quantitative approaches tend to rely more heavily on rules-based quantitative models. As a result, some practitioners and academics refer to the fundamental, judgment-based approaches as “discretionary” and to the rules-based, quantitative approaches as “systematic.” This reading is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces fundamental and quantitative approaches to active management. Section 3 discusses bottom-up, top-down, factor-based, and activist investing strategies. Section 4 describes the process of creating fundamental active investment strategies, including the parameters to consider as well as some of the pitfalls. Section 5 describes the steps required to create quantitative active investment strategies, as well as the pitfalls in a quantitative investment process. Section 6 discusses style classifications of active strategies and the uses and limitations of such classifications.

Fundamental approaches stress the use of human judgment in arriving at an investment decision, whereas quantitative approaches stress the use of rules-based, quantitative models to arrive at a decision., The main differences between fundamental and quantitative approaches include the following characteristics: approach to the decision-making process (subjective versus objective); forecast focus (stock returns versus factor returns); information used (research versus data); focus of the analysis (depth versus breadth); orientation to the data (forward looking versus backward looking); and approach to portfolio risk (emphasis on judgment versus emphasis on optimization techniques)., The main types of active management strategies include bottom-up, top-down, factor-based, and activist., Bottom-up strategies begin at the company level, and use company and industry analyses to assess the intrinsic value of the company and determine whether the stock is undervalued or overvalued relative to its market price., Fundamental managers often focus on one or more of the following company and industry characteristics: business model and branding, competitive advantages, and management and corporate governance., Bottom-up strategies are often divided into value-based approaches and growth-based approaches., Top-down strategies focus on the macroeconomic environment, demographic trends, and government policies to arrive at investment decisions., Top-down strategies are used in several investment decision processes, including the following: country and geographic allocation, sector and industry rotation, equity style rotation, volatility-based strategies, and thematic investment strategies., Quantitative equity investment strategies often use factor-based models. A factor-based strategy aims to identify significant factors that drive stock prices and to construct a portfolio with a positive bias towards such factors., Factors can be grouped based on fundamental characteristics—such as value, growth, and price momentum—or on unconventional data., Activist investors specialize in taking meaningful stakes in listed companies and influencing those companies to make changes to their management, strategy, or capital structures for the purpose of increasing the stock’s value and realizing a gain on their investment., Statistical arbitrage (or “stat arb”) strategies use statistical and technical analysis to exploit pricing anomalies and achieve superior returns. Pairs trading is an example of a popular and simple statistical arbitrage strategy., Event-driven strategies exploit market inefficiencies that may occur around corporate events such as mergers and acquisitions, earnings announcements, bankruptcies, share buybacks, special dividends, and spinoffs., The fundamental active investment process includes the following steps: define the investment universe; prescreen the universe; understand the industry and business; forecast the company’s financial performance; convert forecasts into a target price; construct the portfolio with the desired risk profile; and rebalance the portfolio according to a buy and sell discipline., Pitfalls in fundamental investing include behavioral biases, the value trap, and the growth trap., Behavioral biases can be divided into two groups: cognitive errors and emotional biases. Typical biases that are relevant to active equity management include confirmation bias, illusion of control, availability bias, loss aversion, overconfidence, and regret aversion., The quantitative active investment process includes the following steps: define the investment thesis; acquire, clean, and process the data; backtest the strategy; evaluate the strategy; and construct an efficient portfolio using risk and trading cost models., The pitfalls in quantitative investing include look-ahead and survivorship biases, overfitting, data mining, unrealistic turnover assumptions, transaction costs, and short availability., An investment style generally splits the stock universe into two or three groups, such that each group contains stocks with similar characteristics. The common style characteristics used in active management include value, size, price momentum, volatility, high dividend, and earnings quality. A stock’s membership in an industry, sector, or country group is also used to classify the investment style., Two main approaches are often used in style analysis: a returns-based approach and a holdings-based approach. Holdings-based approaches aggregate the style scores of individual holdings, while returns-based approaches analyze the investment style of portfolio managers by comparing the returns of the strategy to those of a set of style indexes.",/-/media/documents/support/conduct/2010-rules-of-procedure.pdf,

Test 20 Cost of Capital,2020 Curriculum,CFA Program Level I,Corporate Finance,"The member should be able to: calculate and interpret the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of a company; describe how taxes affect the cost of capital from different capital sources; describe the use of target capital structure in estimating WACC and how target capital structure weights may be determined; explain how the marginal cost of capital and the investment opportunity schedule are used to determine the optimal capital budget; explain the marginal cost of capital’s role in determining the net present value of a project; calculate and interpret the cost of debt capital using the yield-to-maturity approach and the debt-rating approach; calculate and interpret the cost of noncallable, nonconvertible preferred stock; calculate and interpret the cost of equity capital using the capital asset pricing model approach, the dividend discount model approach, and the bond-yield-plus risk-premium approach; calculate and interpret the beta and cost of capital for a project; describe uses of country risk premiums in estimating the cost of equity; describe the marginal cost of capital schedule, explain why it may be upward-sloping with respect to additional capital, and calculate and interpret its break-points; explain and demonstrate the correct treatment of flotation costs.","The member should be able to: calculate and interpret the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of a company; describe how taxes affect the cost of capital from different capital sources; describe the use of target capital structure in estimating WACC and how target capital structure weights may be determined; explain how the marginal cost of capital and the investment opportunity schedule are used to determine the optimal capital budget; explain the marginal cost of capital’s role in determining the net present value of a project; calculate and interpret the cost of debt capital using the yield-to-maturity approach and the debt-rating approach; calculate and interpret the cost of noncallable, nonconvertible preferred stock; calculate and interpret the cost of equity capital using the capital asset pricing model approach, the dividend discount model approach, and the bond-yield-plus risk-premium approach; calculate and interpret the beta and cost of capital for a project; describe uses of country risk premiums in estimating the cost of equity; describe the marginal cost of capital schedule, explain why it may be upward-sloping with respect to additional capital, and calculate and interpret its break-points; explain and demonstrate the correct treatment of flotation costs.","The weighted average cost of capital is a weighted average of the after-tax marginal costs of each source of capital: WACC = wdrd(1 – t) + wprp + were, An analyst uses the WACC in valuation. For example, the WACC is used to value a project using the net present value method: NPV = Present value of inflows – Present value of the outflows, The before-tax cost of debt is generally estimated by means of one of the two methods: yield to maturity or bond rating., The yield-to-maturity method of estimating the before-tax cost of debt uses the familiar bond valuation equation. Assuming semi-annual coupon payments, the equation is P0=PMT1(1+rd2)+…+PMTn(1+rd2)n+FV(1+rd2)n=(∑t=1nPMTt(1+rd2)t)+FV(1+rd2)n We solve for the six-month yield (rd/2) and then annualize it to arrive at the before-tax cost of debt, rd., Because interest payments are generally tax-deductible, the after-tax cost is the true, effective cost of debt to the company. If a current yield or bond rating is not available, such as in the case of a private company without rated debt or a project, the estimate of the cost of debt becomes more challenging., The cost of preferred stock is the preferred stock dividend divided by the current preferred stock price: rp=DpPp, The cost of equity is the rate of return required by a company’s common stockholders. We estimate this cost using the CAPM (or its variants) or the dividend discount method., The CAPM is the approach most commonly used to calculate the cost of common stock. The three components needed to calculate the cost of common stock are the risk-free rate, the equity risk premium, and beta: E(Ri)=RF+βi[E(RM)−RF], When estimating the cost of equity capital using the CAPM when we do not have publicly traded equity, we may be able to use the pure-play method in which we estimate the unlevered beta for a company with similar business risk, βU, βU,comparable=βL,comparable[1+((1−tcomparable)DcomparableEcomparable)] and then lever this beta to reflect the financial risk of the project or company: βL,project=βU,comparable[1+((1−tproject)DprojectEproject)], It is often the case that country and foreign exchange risk are diversified so that we can use the estimated β in the CAPM analysis. However, in the case in which these risks cannot be diversified away, we can adjust our measure of systematic risk by a country equity premium to reflect this nondiversified risk: Country equity premium=Sovereign yield spread [Annualized standard deviationof equity indexAnnualized standard deviation of thesovereign bond market in termsof the developed market currency], The dividend discount model approach is an alternative approach to calculating the cost of equity, whereby the cost of equity is estimated as follows: re=D1P0+g, We can estimate the growth rate in the dividend discount model by using published forecasts of analysts or by estimating the sustainable growth rate: g=(1−D/EPS)ROE, In estimating the cost of equity, an alternative to the CAPM and dividend discount approaches is the bond yield plus risk premium approach. In this approach, we estimate the before-tax cost of debt and add a risk premium that reflects the additional risk associated with the company’s equity., The marginal cost of capital schedule is a graph plotting the new funds raised by a company on the x-axis and the cost of capital on the y-axis. The cost of capital is level to the point at which one of the costs of capital changes, such as when the company bumps up against a debt covenant, requiring it to use another form of capital. We calculate a break point using information on when the different sources’ costs change and the proportions that the company uses when it raises additional capital: Break point=Amount of capital at which the source's cost of capital changesProportion of new capital raised from the source, Flotation costs are costs incurred in the process of raising additional capital. The preferred method of including these costs in the analysis is as an initial cash flow in the valuation analysis., Survey evidence tells us that the CAPM method is the most popular method used by companies in estimating the cost of equity. The CAPM is more popular with larger, publicly traded companies, which is understandable considering the additional analyses and assumptions required in estimating systematic risk for a private company or project.",,

Top-down approaches usually begin at the level of the overall economy. Bottom-up approaches begin at the level of the individual company or unit within the company (e.g., business segment). Time-series approaches are considered bottom-up, although time-series analysis can be a tool used in top-down approaches. Hybrid approaches include elements of topdown and bottom-up approaches., In a “growth relative to GDP growth” approach to forecasting revenue, the analyst forecasts the growth rate of nominal gross domestic product and industry and company growth relative to GDP growth., In a “market growth and market share” approach to forecasting revenue, the analyst combines forecasts of growth in particular markets with forecasts of a company’s market share in the individual markets., Operating margins that are positively correlated with sales provide evidence of economies of scale in an industry., Some balance sheet line items, such as retained earnings, flow directly from the income statement, whereas accounts receivable, accounts payable, and inventory are very closely linked to income statement projections., A common way to model working capital accounts is to use efficiency ratios., Return on invested capital (ROIC), defined as net operating profit less adjusted taxes divided by the difference between operating assets and operating liabilities, is an after-tax measure of the profitability of investing in a company. High and persistent levels of ROIC are often associated with having a competitive advantage., Competitive factors affect a company’s ability to negotiate lower input prices with suppliers and to raise prices for products and services. Porter’s five forces framework can be used as a basis for identifying such factors., Inflation (deflation) affects pricing strategy depending on industry structure, competitive forces, and the nature of consumer demand., When a technological development results in a new product that threatens to cannibalize demand for an existing product, a unit forecast for the new product combined with an expected cannibalization factor can be used to estimate the impact on future demand for the existing product., Factors influencing the choice of the explicit forecast horizon include the projected holding period, an investor’s average portfolio turnover, cyclicality of an industry, company specific factors, and employer preferences.",,

For infinitely lived assets such as common stocks, n runs to infinity., Several alternative streams of expected cash flows can be used to value equities, including dividends, free cash flow, and residual income. A discounted dividend approach is most suitable for dividend-paying stocks in which the company has a discernible dividend policy that has an understandable relationship to the company’s profitability, and the investor has a noncontrol (minority ownership) perspective., The free cash flow approach (FCFF or FCFE) might be appropriate when the company does not pay dividends, dividends differ substantially from FCFE, free cash flows align with profitability, or the investor takes a control (majority ownership) perspective., The residual income approach can be useful when the company does not pay dividends (as an alternative to a FCF approach) or free cash flow is negative., The DDM with a single holding period gives stock value as V0=D1(1+r)1+P1(1+r)1=D1 +P1(1+r)1 where D 1 is the expected dividend at time 1 and V0 is the stock’s (expected) value at time 0. Assuming that V0 is equal to today’s market price, P 0, the expected holding-period return is r=D1+P1P0−1=D1P0+P1−P0P0, The expression for the DDM for any given finite holding period n and the gen - eral expression for the DDM are, respectively, V0=∑t=1nDt(1+r)t+Pn(1+r)n and V0=∑t=1∞Dt(1+r)t, There are two main approaches to the problem of forecasting dividends. First, an analyst can assign the entire stream of expected future dividends to one of several stylized growth patterns. Second, an analyst can forecast a finite number of dividends individually up to a terminal point and value the remaining divi - dends either by assigning them to a stylized growth pattern or by forecasting share price as of the terminal point of the dividend forecasts., The Gordon growth model assumes that dividends grow at a constant rate g for - ever, so that D t = Dt– 1(1 + g). The dividend stream in the Gordon growth model has a value of V0=D0(1+g)r−g, or V0=D1r−g where r>g, The value of noncallable fixed-rate perpetual preferred stock is V0 = D / r, where D is the stock’s (constant) annual dividend., Assuming that price equals value, the Gordon growth model estimate of a stock’s expected rate of return is r=D0(1+g)P0+g=D1P0+g, Given an estimate of the next-period dividend and the stock’s required rate of return, the Gordon growth model can be used to estimate the dividend growth rate implied by the current market price (making a constant growth rate assumption). The present value of growth opportunities (PVGO) is the part of a stock’s total value, V0, that comes from profitable future growth opportunities in contrast to the value associated with assets already in place. The relationship is V0 = E 1 / r + PVGO, where E 1 / r is defined as the no-growth value per share., The leading price-to-earnings ratio ( P 0 / E 1) and the trailing price-to-earnings ratio ( P 0 / E 0) can be expressed in terms of the Gordon growth model as, respectively, P0E1=D1/E1r−g=1−b r−g and P0E0=D0(1+g)/E0r−g=(1−b)(1+g)r−g The above expressions give a stock’s justified price-to-earnings ratio based on forecasts of fundamentals (given that the Gordon growth model is appropriate)., The Gordon growth model may be useful for valuing broad-based equity indexes and the stock of businesses with earnings that are expected to grow at a stable rate comparable to or lower than the nominal growth rate of the economy., Gordon growth model values are very sensitive to the assumed growth rate and required rate of return., For many companies, growth falls into phases. In the growth phase, a company enjoys an abnormally high growth rate in earnings per share, called super - normal growth. In the transition phase, earnings growth slows. In the mature phase, the company reaches an equilibrium in which such factors as earnings growth and the return on equity stabilize at levels that can be sustained long term. Analysts often apply multistage DCF models to value the stock of a company with multistage growth prospects., The two-stage dividend discount model assumes different growth rates in Stage 1 and Stage 2 V0=∑t=1nD0(1+gS)t(1+r)t+D0(1+gS)n(1+gL) (1+r)n(r−gL) where gS is the expected dividend growth rate in the first period and gL is the expected growth rate in the second period., The terminal stock value, Vn, is sometimes found with the Gordon growth model or with some other method, such as applying a P/E multiplier to forecasted EPS as of the terminal date., The H-model assumes that the dividend growth rate declines linearly from a high supernormal rate to the normal growth rate during Stage 1, and then grows at a constant normal growth rate thereafter: V0=D0(1+gL)r−gL+D0H(gS−gL)r−gL=D0(1+gL)+D0H(gS−gL)r−gL, There are two basic three-stage models. In one version, the growth rate in the middle stage is constant. In the second version, the growth rate declines linearly in Stage 2 and becomes constant and normal in Stage 3., Spreadsheet models are very flexible, providing the analyst with the ability to value any pattern of expected dividends., In addition to valuing equities, the IRR of a DDM, assuming assets are correctly priced in the marketplace, has been used to estimate required returns. For simpler models (such as the one-period model, the Gordon growth model, and the H-model), well-known formulas may be used to calculate these rates of return. For many dividend streams, however, the rate of return must be found by trial and error, producing a discount rate that equates the present value of the forecasted dividend stream to the current market price., Multistage DDM models can accommodate a wide variety of patterns of expected dividends. Even though such models may use stylized assumptions about growth, they can provide useful approximations., Dividend growth rates can be obtained from analyst forecasts, statistical forecasting models, or company fundamentals. The sustainable growth rate depends on the ROE and the earnings retention rate, b: g = b × ROE. This expression can be expanded further, using the DuPont formula, as g=Net income−DividendsNet income×Net incomeSales ×SalesTotal assets×Total assetsShareholders' equity",,

The two types of objectives are risk and return. The two types of constraints are internal (posed by the characteristics of the investor) and external (imposed by outside agencies)., An investment policy statement is a written planning document that governs all investment decisions for the client. This document integrates a client’s needs, preferences, and circumstances into a statement of that client’s objectives and constraints., A policy or strategic asset allocation establishes exposures to IPS-permissible asset classes in a manner designed to satisfy the client’s long-run objectives and constraints. The plan reflects the interaction of objectives and constraints with long-run capital market expectations., In a passive investment strategy approach, portfolio composition does not react to changes in expectations; an example is indexing, which involves a fixed portfolio designed to replicate the returns on an index. An active approach involves holding a portfolio different from a benchmark or comparison portfolio for the purpose of producing positive excess risk-adjusted returns. A semiactive approach refers to an indexing approach with controlled use of weights different from the benchmark., The portfolio selection/composition decision concerns portfolio construction and often uses portfolio optimization to combine assets efficiently to achieve return and risk objectives. The portfolio implementation decision concerns the trading desk function of implementing portfolio decisions and involves explicit and implicit transaction costs., The elements of performance evaluation are performance measurement, attribution, and appraisal. Performance measurement is the calculation of portfolio rates of return. Performance attribution is the analysis of those rates of return to determine the factors that explain how the return was achieved. Performance appraisal assesses how well the portfolio manager performed on a risk-adjusted basis, whether absolute or relative to a benchmark., Portfolio monitoring and rebalancing use feedback to manage ongoing exposures to available investment opportunities in order to continually satisfy the client’s current objectives and constraints., Portfolio management is an ongoing process in which the investment objectives and constraints are identified and specified, investment policies and strategies are developed, the portfolio composition is decided in detail, portfolio decisions are initiated by portfolio managers and implemented by traders, portfolio performance is evaluated, investor and market conditions are monitored, and any necessary rebalancing is implemented., To determine a risk objective, there are several steps: specify a risk measure (or measures) such as standard deviation, determine the investor’s willingness to take risk, determine the investor’s ability to take risk, synthesize the investor’s willingness and ability into the investor’s risk tolerance, and specify an objective using the measure(s) in the first step above., To determine a return objective, there are several steps: specify a return measure such as total nominal return, determine the investor’s stated return desire, determine the investor’s required rate of return, and specify an objective in terms of the return measure in the first step above., A liquidity requirement is a need for cash in excess of the contribution rate or the savings rate at a specified point in time. This need may be either anticipated or unanticipated., A time horizon is the time period associated with an investment objective. Investment objectives and associated time horizons may be short term, long term, or a combination of these two. A multistage horizon is a combination of shorter term and longer term horizons. A time horizon can be considered a constraint because shorter time horizons generally indicate lower risk tolerance and hence constrain portfolio choice, making it more conservative., A tax concern is any issue arising from a tax structure that reduces the amount of the total return that can be used for current needs or reinvested for future growth. Tax concerns constrain portfolio choice. If differences exist between the tax rates applying to investment income and capital gains, tax considerations will influence the choice of investment., Legal and regulatory factors are external considerations that may constrain investment decision making. For example, a government agency may limit the use of certain asset classes in retirement portfolios., Unique circumstances are internal factors (other than a liquidity requirement, time horizon, or tax concerns) that may constrain portfolio choices. For example, an investor seeking to avoid investments in tobacco companies will place an internal constraint on portfolio choice.",,

Differences exist in countries’ regulatory requirements for companies to fund defined benefit pension plan obligations., Both IFRS and US GAAP require companies to report on their balance sheet a pension liability or asset equal to the projected benefit obligation minus the fair value of plan assets. The amount of a pension asset that can be reported is subject to a ceiling., Under IFRS, the components of periodic pension cost are recognized as follows: Service cost is recognized in P&L, net interest income/expense is recognized in P&L, and re-measurements are recognized in OCI and are not amortized to future P&L., Under US GAAP, the components of periodic pension cost recognized in P&L include current service costs, interest expense on the pension obligation, and expected returns on plan assets (which reduces the cost). Other components of periodic pension cost including past service costs, actuarial gains and losses, and differences between expected and actual returns on plan assets are recognized in OCI and amortized to future P&L., Estimates of the future obligation under defined benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefits are sensitive to numerous assumptions, including discount rates, assumed annual compensation increases, expected return on plan assets, and assumed health care cost inflation., Employee compensation packages are structured to fulfill varied objectives, including satisfying employees’ needs for liquidity, retaining employees, and providing incentives to employees., Common components of employee compensation packages are salary, bonuses, and share-based compensation., Share based compensation serves to align employees’ interests with those of the shareholders. It includes stocks and stock options., Share based compensation has the advantage of requiring no current-period cash outlays., Share based compensation expense is reported at fair value under IFRS and US GAAP., The valuation technique, or option pricing model, that a company uses is an important choice in determining fair value and is disclosed., Key assumptions and input into option pricing models include such items as exercise price, stock price volatility, estimated life of each award, estimated number of options that will be forfeited, dividend yield, and the risk free rate of interest. Certain assumptions are highly subjective, such as stock price volatility or the expected life of stock options, and can greatly change the estimated fair value and thus compensation expense.",,

The WACC formula is WACC=MV(Debt)MV(Debt)+MV(Equity)rd(1−Tax rate) +MV(Equity)MV(Debt)+MV(Equity)r, The value of the firm if FCFF is growing at a constant rate is Firm value=FCFF1WACC−g=FCFF0(1+g)WACC−g, With the FCFE valuation approach, the value of equity can be found by dis - counting FCFE at the required rate of return on equity, r : Equity value=∑t=1∞FCFEt(1+r)t Dividing the total value of equity by the number of outstanding shares gives the value per share., The value of equity if FCFE is growing at a constant rate is Equity value=FCFE1r−g=FCFE0(1+g)r−g, FCFF and FCFE are frequently calculated by starting with net income: FCFF = NI + NCC + Int(1 – Tax rate) – FCInv – WCInv FCFE = NI + NCC – FCInv – WCInv + Net borrowing, FCFF and FCFE are related to each other as follows: FCFE = FCFF – Int(1 – Tax rate) + Net borrowing, FCFF and FCFE can be calculated by starting from cash flow from operations: FCFF = CFO + Int(1 – Tax rate) – FCInv FCFE = CFO – FCInv + Net borrowing, FCFF can also be calculated from EBIT or EBITDA: FCFF = EBIT(1 – Tax rate) + Dep – FCInv – WCInv FCFF = EBITDA(1 – Tax rate) + Dep(Tax rate) – FCInv – WCInv FCFE can then be found by using FCFE = FCFF – Int(1 – Tax rate) + Net borrowing., Finding CFO, FCFF, and FCFE may require careful interpretation of corpo - rate financial statements. In some cases, the needed information may not be transparent., Earnings components such as net income, EBIT, EBITDA, and CFO should not be used as cash flow measures to value a firm. These earnings components either double-count or ignore parts of the cash flow stream., FCFF or FCFE valuation expressions can be easily adapted to accommodate complicated capital structures, such as those that include preferred stock., A general expression for the two-stage FCFF valuation model is Firm value=∑t=1nFCFFt(1+WACC)t+FCFFn+1(WACC−g)1(1+WACC)n, A general expression for the two-stage FCFE valuation model is Equity value=∑t=1nFCFEt(1+r)t+FCFEn+1r−g1(1+r)n, One common two-stage model assumes a constant growth rate in each stage, and a second common model assumes declining growth in Stage 1 followed by a long-run sustainable growth rate in Stage 2., To forecast FCFF and FCFE, analysts build a variety of models of varying complexity. A common approach is to forecast sales, with profitability, investments, and financing derived from changes in sales., Three-stage models are often considered to be good approximations for cash flow streams that, in reality, fluctuate from year to year., Nonoperating assets, such as excess cash and marketable securities, noncurrent investment securities, and nonperforming assets, are usually segregated from the company’s operating assets. They are valued separately and then added to the value of the company’s operating assets to find total firm value.",,

Interest rate swaps are the most common type and involve the exchange of fixed interest payments for floating interest payments., Option contracts are contingent claims in which one of the counterparties determines whether and when a trade will settle. The option buyer pays a premium to the seller for the right to transact the underlying in the future at an agreed-upon exercise price., Credit default swap (CDS) contracts allow an investor to manage the risk of loss from issuer default separately from a cash bond., Market participants often create similar exposures to an underlying using firm commitments and contingent claims, although these derivative instrument types involve different payoff and profit profiles.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2023/RR-2023-L1V5R4-forward-commitment-contingent-claim-features-instruments.pdf,

The futures price, f0(T), equals the spot price compounded at the risk-free rate as in the case of a forward contract., The primary difference between forward and futures valuation is the daily settlement of futures gains and losses via a margin account. Daily settlement resets the futures contract value to zero at the current futures price ft(T). This process continues until contract maturity and the futures price converge to the spot price, ST., The cumulative realized mark-to-market (MTM) gain or loss on a futures contract is approximately the same as for a comparable forward contract., Daily settlement and margin requirements give rise to different cash flow patterns between futures and forwards, resulting in a pricing difference between the two contract types. The difference depends on both interest rate volatility and the correlation between interest rates and futures prices., The futures price for short-term interest rate futures is given by (100 – yield), where yield is expressed in percentage terms. There is a price difference between interest rate futures and forward rate agreements (FRAs) due to convexity bias., The emergence of derivatives central clearing has introduced futures-like margining requirements for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, such as forwards.

Projects undertaken by companies to maintain a business including operating efficiencies are (1) going concern projects and (2) regulatory/compliance projects, while (3) expansion projects and (4) other projects are undertaken by companies to strategically expand or grow their operations., Capital allocation supports the most critical investments for many corporations—their investments in long-term assets. The principles of capital allocation are also relevant and can be applied to other corporate investing and financing decisions and to security analysis and portfolio management., The typical steps companies take in the capital allocation process are (1) idea generation, (2) investment analysis, (3) capital allocation planning, and (4) postaudit and monitoring. Companies should base their capital allocation decisions on the investment project’s incremental after-tax cash flows discounted at the opportunity cost of funds. In addition, companies should ignore financing costs because both the cost of debt and the cost of other capital are captured in the discount rate used in the analysis., The NPV of an investment project is the present value of its after-tax cash flows (or the present value of its after-tax cash inflows minus the present value of its after-tax outflows) or NPV = Σ t=0 n CF t _ (1 + r) t, where the investment outlays are negative cash flows included in CFt, and r is the required rate of return for the investment., Microsoft Excel functions to solve for the NPV for both conventional and unconventional cash flow patterns are NPV or = NPV (rate, values), and XNPV or = XNPV (rate, values, dates), where “rate” is the discount rate, “values” are the cash flows, and “dates” are the dates of each of the cash flows., The IRR is the discount rate that makes the present value of all future cash flows of the project sum to zero.

The exercise value is the option’s value if it were immediately exercisable, whereas the time value captures the possibility that the passage of time and the variability of the underlying price will increase the profitability of exercise at maturity., Option moneyness expresses the relationship between the underlying price and the exercise price. A put–call option is “at the money” when the underlying price equals the exercise price. An option is more likely to be exercised if it is “in the money”—with an underlying price above (for a call) or below (for a put) the exercise price—and is less likely to be exercised if it is “out of the money.”, Because of their asymmetric payoff profile, options are characterized by no-arbitrage price bounds. The lower bound is a function of the present value of the exercise price and the underlying price, whereas the upper bound is the underlying price for a call and the exercise price for a put., As in the case of forward commitments, the replication of option contracts uses a combination of long (for a call) or short (for a put) positions in an underlying asset and borrowing or lending cash., The replicating transaction for an option is based on a proportion of the underlying, which is closely associated with the moneyness of the option., The underlying price, the exercise price, the time to maturity, the risk-free rate, the volatility of the underlying price, and any income or cost associated with owning the underlying asset are key factors in determining the value of an option., Changes in the volatility of the underlying price and the time to expiration usually will have the same directional effect on put and call option values.

Top-down approaches usually begin at the level of the overall economy. Bottom-up approaches begin at the level of the individual company or unit within the company (e.g., business segment). Time-series approaches are considered bottom-up, although time-series analysis can be a tool used in top-down approaches. Hybrid approaches include elements of top-down and bottom-up approaches., In a “growth relative to GDP growth” approach to forecasting revenue, the analyst forecasts the growth rate of nominal GDP and industry and company growth relative to GDP growth., In a “market growth and market share” approach to forecasting revenue, the analyst combines forecasts of growth in particular markets with forecasts of a company’s market share in the individual markets., Operating margins that are positively correlated with sales provide evidence of economies of scale in an industry., Some balance sheet line items, such as retained earnings, flow directly from the income statement, whereas accounts receivable, accounts payable, and inventory are closely linked to income statement projections., A common way to model working capital accounts is to use efficiency ratios., Return on invested capital (ROIC), defined as net operating profit less adjusted taxes divided by the difference between operating assets and operating liabilities, is an after-tax measure of profitability.

Rather, it adjusts for the degrees of freedom by incorporating the number of independent variables., Adjusted R2 will increase (decrease) if a variable is added to the model that has a coefficient with an absolute value of its t-statistic greater (less) than 1.0., Akaike’s information criterion (AIC) and Schwarz’s Bayesian information criteria (BIC) are also used to evaluate model fit and select the “best” model among a group with the same dependent variable. AIC is preferred if the purpose is prediction, BIC is preferred if goodness of fit is the goal, and lower values of both measures are better., Hypothesis tests of a single coefficient in a multiple regression, using t-tests, are identical to those in simple regression., The joint F-test is used to jointly test a subset of variables in a multiple regression, where the “restricted” model is based on a narrower set of independent variables nested in the broader “unrestricted” model. The null hypothesis is that the slope coefficients of all independent variables outside the restricted model are zero., The general linear F-test is an extension of the joint F-test, where the null hypothesis is that the slope coefficients on all independent variables in the unrestricted model are equal to zero., Predicting the value of the dependent variable using an estimated multiple regression model is similar to that in simple regression. First, sum, for each independent variable, the estimated slope coefficient multiplied by the assumed value of that variable, and then add the estimated intercept coefficient., In multiple regression, the confidence interval around the forecasted value of the dependent variable reflects both model error and sampling error (from forecasting the independent variables); the larger the sampling error, the larger is the standard error of the forecast of Y and the wider is the confidence interval.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level2/level2a/RR_2024_L2V1R2_evaluating_regression_model_fit.pdf,

Unconditional heteroskedasticity is when the error variance is not correlated with the independent variables, whereas conditional heteroskedasticity exists when the error variance is correlated with the values of the independent variables., Unconditional heteroskedasticity creates no major problems for statistical inference, but conditional heteroskedasticity is problematic because it results in underestimation of the regression coefficients’ standard errors, so t-statistics are inflated and Type I errors are more likely., Conditional heteroskedasticity can be detected using the Breusch–Pagan (BP) test, and the bias it creates in the regression model can be corrected by computing robust standard errors., Serial correlation (or autocorrelation) occurs when regression errors are correlated across observations and may be a serious problem in time-series regressions. Serial correlation can lead to inconsistent coefficient estimates, and it underestimates standard errors, so t-statistics are inflated (as with conditional heteroskedasticity)., The Breusch–Godfrey (BG) test is a robust method for detecting serial correlation. The BG test uses residuals from the original regression as the dependent variable run against initial regressors plus lagged residuals, and H0 is the coefficients of the lagged residuals are zero., The biased estimates of standard errors caused by serial correlation can be corrected using robust standard errors, which also correct for conditional heteroskedasticity., Multicollinearity occurs with high pairwise correlations between independent variables or if three or more independent variables form approximate linear combinations that are highly correlated., Multicollinearity results in inflated standard errors and reduced t-statistics., The variance inflation factor (VIF) is a measure for quantifying multicollinearity. If VIFj is 1 for Xj, then there is no correlation between Xj and the other regressors. VIFj > 5 warrants further investigation, and VIFj > 10 indicates serious multicollinearity requiring correction., Solutions to multicollinearity include dropping one or more of the regression variables, using a different proxy for one of the variables, or increasing the sample size.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level2/level2a/RR_2024_L2V1R3_model_misspecification.pdf,

Excessive risk taking in the past by market participants through the use of derivatives has contributed to market destabilization and systemic risk., Issuers typically use derivative instruments to offset or hedge market-based underlying exposures that affect their assets, liabilities, and earnings., Issuers usually seek hedge accounting treatment for derivatives to minimize income statement and cash flow volatility., Investors use derivatives to modify investment portfolio cash flows, replicate investment strategy returns in cash markets, and create exposures unavailable to cash market participants.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2023/RR-2023-L1V5R5-derivative-benefits-risks-issuer-investor-uses.pdf,

Performance Calculation and Appraisal of Alternative Investments,2023 Curriculum,CFA Program Level I,Alternative Investments,"The member should be able to: describe issues in performance appraisal of alternative investments, and calculate and interpret returns of alternative investments both before and after fees.","The member should be able to: describe issues in performance appraisal of alternative investments, and calculate and interpret returns of alternative investments both before and after fees.","Conducting performance appraisal on alternative investments can be challenging because these investments are often characterized by asymmetric risk–return profiles, limited portfolio transparency, illiquidity, product complexity, and complex fee structures., Traditional risk and return measures (such as mean return, standard deviation of returns, and beta) may provide an inadequate picture of alternative investments’ risk and return characteristics. Moreover, these measures may be unreliable or not representative of specific investments., A variety of ratios can be calculated to review the performance of alternative investments, including the Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, Calmar ratio, and mean adequacy ratio (MAR). The internal rate of return (IRR) and multiple on invested capital (MOIC) calculations are often used to evaluate private equity investments, and the cap rate is often used to evaluate real estate investments., Redemption rules, lockup periods, and timing differences in reporting can bring special challenges to performance appraisal of alternative investments.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2023/RR-2023-L1V5R14-performance-calculation-appraisal-alternative-investments.pdf,
Corporate Restructuring,2024 Curriculum,CFA Program Level II,Corporate Finance,"The member should be able to: explain types of corporate restructurings and issuers’ motivations for pursuing them; explain the initial evaluation of a corporate restructuring; demonstrate valuation methods for, and interpret valuations of, companies involved in corporate restructurings; demonstrate how corporate restructurings affect an issuer’s earnings per share (EPS); net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) ratio; and weighted average cost of capital; evaluate corporate investment actions, including equity investments, joint ventures, and acquisitions; evaluate corporate divestment actions, including sales and spin-offs; and evaluate cost and balance sheet restructurings.","The member should be able to: explain types of corporate restructurings and issuers’ motivations for pursuing them; explain the initial evaluation of a corporate restructuring; demonstrate valuation methods for, and interpret valuations of, companies involved in corporate restructurings; demonstrate how corporate restructurings affect an issuer’s earnings per share (EPS); net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) ratio; and weighted average cost of capital; evaluate corporate investment actions, including equity investments, joint ventures, and acquisitions; evaluate corporate divestment actions, including sales and spin-offs; and evaluate cost and balance sheet restructurings.","Corporate issuers seek to alter their destiny, as described by the corporate life cycle, by taking actions known as restructurings., Restructurings include investment actions that increase the size and scope of an issuer’s business, divestment actions that decrease size or scope, and restructuring actions that do not affect scope but improve performance., Investment actions include equity investments, joint ventures, and acquisitions. Investment actions are often made by issuers seeking growth, synergies, or undervalued targets., Divestment actions include sales and spin-offs and are made by issuers seeking to increase growth or profitability or reduce risk by shedding certain divisions and assets., Restructuring actions, including cost cutting, balance sheet restructurings, and reorganizations, do not change the size or scope of issuers but are aimed at improving returns on capital to historical or peer levels., The evaluation of a corporate restructuring is composed of four phases: initial evaluation, preliminary evaluation, modeling, and updating the investment thesis. The entire evaluation generally is done only for material restructurings., The initial evaluation of a corporate restructuring answers the following questions: What is happening? When is it happening? Is it material? And why is it happening?, Materiality is defined by both size and fit. One rule of thumb for size is that large actions are those that are greater than 10% of an issuer’s enterprise value (e.g., for an acquisition, consideration in excess of 10% of the acquirer’s preannouncement enterprise value). Fit refers to the alignment between the action and an analyst’s expectations for the issuer., The three common valuation methods for companies involved in corporate restructurings, during the preliminary valuation phase of the evaluation, are comparable company, comparable transaction, and premium paid analysis., Corporate restructurings must be modeled on the financial statements based on the situational specifics. Estimated financial statements that include the effect of a restructuring are known as pro forma financial statements., The weighted average cost of capital for an issuer is determined by the weights of different capital types and the constituent costs of capital. The costs of capital are influenced by both bottom-up and top-down drivers. Bottom-up drivers include stability, profitability, leverage, and asset specificity. Corporate restructurings affect the cost of capital by affecting these drivers.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level2/level2a/RR_2024_L2V3R4_corporate_restructuring.pdf,

On any settlement date, the value of a swap equals the current settlement value plus the present value of all remaining future swap settlements., A swap contract’s value changes as time passes and interest rates change. For example, a rise in expected forward rates increases the present value of floating payments, causing a mark-to-market (MTM) gain for the fixed-rate payer (floating-rate receiver) and an MTM loss for the fixed-rate receiver (floating-rate payer).",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level1a/RR_2024_L1V5R7_v1.pdf,

The functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which an entity operates. Normally, the local currency is an entity’s functional currency. For accounting purposes, any currency other than an entity’s functional currency is a foreign currency for that entity. The currency in which financial statement amounts are presented is known as the presentation currency. In most cases, the presentation currency will be the same as the local currency., When an export sale (import purchase) on an account is denominated in a foreign currency, the sales revenue (inventory) and foreign currency account receivable (account payable) are translated into the seller’s (buyer’s) functional currency using the exchange rate on the transaction date. Any change in the functional currency value of the foreign currency account receivable (account payable) that occurs between the transaction date and the settlement date is recognized as a foreign currency transaction gain or loss in net income., If a balance sheet date falls between the transaction date and the settlement date, the foreign currency account receivable (account payable) is translated at the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. The change in the functional currency value of the foreign currency account receivable (account payable) is recognized as a foreign currency transaction gain or loss in income. Analysts should understand that these gains and losses are unrealized at the time they are recognized and might or might not be realized when the transactions are settled., A foreign currency transaction gain arises when an entity has a foreign currency receivable and the foreign currency strengthens or it has a foreign currency payable and the foreign currency weakens. A foreign currency transaction loss arises when an entity has a foreign currency receivable and the foreign currency weakens or it has a foreign currency payable and the foreign currency strengthens., Companies must disclose the net foreign currency gain or loss included in income. They may choose to report foreign currency transaction gains and losses as a component of operating income or as a component of non-operating income. If two companies choose to report foreign currency transaction gains and losses differently, operating profit and operating profit margin might not be directly comparable between the two companies., To prepare consolidated financial statements, foreign currency financial statements of foreign operations must be translated into the parent company’s presentation currency. The major conceptual issues related to this translation process are, What is the appropriate exchange rate for translating each financial statement item, and how should the resulting translation adjustment be reflected in the consolidated financial statements? Two different translation methods are used worldwide., Under the current rate method, assets and liabilities are translated at the current exchange rate, equity items are translated at historical exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated at the exchange rate that existed when the underlying transaction occurred. For practical reasons, an average exchange rate is often used to translate income items., Under the temporal method, monetary assets (and non-monetary assets measured at current value) and monetary liabilities (and non-monetary liabilities measured at current value) are translated at the current exchange rate. Non-monetary assets and liabilities not measured at current value and equity items are translated at historical exchange rates. Revenues and expenses, other than those expenses related to non-monetary assets, are translated at the exchange rate that existed when the underlying transaction occurred. Expenses related to non-monetary assets are translated at the exchange rates used for the related assets., Under both IFRS and US GAAP, the functional currency of a foreign operation determines the method to be used in translating its foreign currency financial statements into the parent’s presentation currency and whether the resulting translation adjustment is recognized in income or as a separate component of equity., The foreign currency financial statements of a foreign operation that has a foreign currency as its functional currency are translated using the current rate method, and the translation adjustment is accumulated as a separate component of equity. The cumulative translation adjustment related to a specific foreign entity is transferred to net income when that entity is sold or otherwise disposed of. The balance sheet risk exposure associated with the current rate method is equal to the foreign subsidiary’s net asset position., The foreign currency financial statements of a foreign operation that has the parent’s presentation currency as its functional currency are translated using the temporal method, and the translation adjustment is included as a gain or loss in income. US GAAP refer to this process as remeasurement. The balance sheet exposure associated with the temporal method is equal to the foreign subsidiary’s net monetary asset/liability position (adjusted for non-monetary items measured at current value)., IFRS and US GAAP differ with respect to the translation of foreign currency financial statements of foreign operations located in a highly inflationary country. Under IFRS, the foreign currency statements are first restated for local inflation and then translated using the current exchange rate. Under US GAAP, the foreign currency financial statements are translated using the temporal method, with no restatement for inflation., Applying different translation methods for a given foreign operation can result in very different amounts reported in the parent’s consolidated financial statements., Companies must disclose the total amount of translation gain or loss reported in income and the amount of translation adjustment included in a separate component of stockholders’ equity. Companies are not required to separately disclose the component of translation gain or loss arising from foreign currency transactions and the component arising from application of the temporal method., Disclosures related to translation adjustments reported in equity can be used to include these as gains and losses in determining an adjusted amount of income following a clean-surplus approach to income measurement., Foreign currency translation rules are well established in both IFRS and US GAAP. Fortunately, except for the treatment of foreign operations located in highly inflationary countries, the two sets of standards have no major differences in this area. The ability to understand the impact of foreign currency translation on the financial results of a company using IFRS should apply equally well in the analysis of financial statements prepared in accordance with US GAAP., An analyst can obtain information about the tax impact of multinational operations from companies’ disclosure on effective tax rates., For a multinational company, sales growth is driven not only by changes in volume and price but also by changes in the exchange rates between the reporting currency and the currency in which sales are made. Arguably, growth in sales that comes from changes in volume or price is more sustainable than growth in sales that comes from changes in exchange rates.",,

They are amenable to a net asset value approach to valuation because of the existence of active private markets for their real estate assets., Compared with REOCs, REITs offer higher yields and income tax exemptions but have less operating flexibility to invest in a broad range of real estate activities and less potential for growth from reinvesting their operating cash flows because of their high income-to-payout ratios., In assessing the investment merits of REITs, investors analyze the effects of trends in general economic activity, retail sales, job creation, population growth, and new supply and demand for specific types of space. Investors also pay particular attention to occupancies, leasing activity, rental rates, remaining lease terms, in-place rents compared with market rents, costs to maintain space and re-lease space, tenants’ financial health and tenant concentration in the portfolio, financial leverage, debt maturities and costs, and the quality of management and governance., Analysts make adjustments to the historical cost-based financial statements of REITs and REOCs to obtain better measures of current income and net worth. The three principal figures they calculate and use are (1) funds from operations or accounting net earnings, excluding depreciation, deferred tax charges, and gains or losses on sales of property and debt restructuring; (2) adjusted funds from operations, or funds from operations adjusted to remove straight-line rent and to provide for maintenance-type capital expenditures and leasing costs, including leasing agents’ commissions and tenants’ improvement allowances; and (3) net asset value or the difference between a real estate company’s asset and liability ranking prior to shareholders’ equity, all valued at market values instead of accounting book values., REITs and some REOCs generally return a significant portion of their income to their investors as required by law and, as a result, tend to pay high dividends. Thus, dividend discount or discounted cash flow models for valuation are also applicable. These valuation approaches are applied in the same manner as they are for shares in other industries. Usually, investors use two- or three-step dividend discount models with near-term, intermediate-term, and/or long-term growth assumptions.

"Arbitrage, Replication, and the Cost of Carry in Pricing Derivatives​",2023 Curriculum,CFA Program Level I,Derivatives,"The member should be able to: explain how the concepts of arbitrage and replication are used in pricing derivatives, and explain the difference between the spot and expected future price of an underlying and the cost of carry associated with holding the underlying asset.","The member should be able to: explain how the concepts of arbitrage and replication are used in pricing derivatives, and explain the difference between the spot and expected future price of an underlying and the cost of carry associated with holding the underlying asset.","Forward commitments are an alternative means of taking a long or short position in an underlying asset. A link between forward prices and spot prices exists to prevent investors from taking advantage of arbitrage opportunities across cash and derivative instruments., A forward commitment may be replicated with a long or short spot position in the underlying asset and borrowing or lending at a risk-free rate. Investors can recreate a variety of positions by using appropriate combinations of spot, forward, and risk-free positions., The risk-free rate provides a fundamental link between spot and forward prices for underlying assets with no additional costs or benefits of ownership., The cost of carry is the net of the costs and benefits related to owning an underlying asset for a specific period and must be factored into the difference between the spot price and a forward price of a specific underlying asset., The cost of carry may include costs, such as storage and insurance for physical commodities, or benefits of ownership, such as dividends for stocks and interest for bonds. Foreign exchange represents a special case in which the cost of carry is the interest rate differential between two currencies., Forward prices may be greater than or less than the underlying spot price, depending on the specific cost of carry associated with owning the underlying asset.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2023/RR-2023-L1V5R6-arbitrage-replication-cost-carry-pricing-derivatives.pdf,

Capital provided in the form of equity investments is called PE, whereas capital provided as a loan or other form of debt is called private debt., PE refers to investment in privately owned companies or in public companies intended to be taken private. Key PE investment strategies include leveraged buyouts (e.g., management buyouts [MBOs] and management buy-ins [MBIs]) and venture capital. Primary exit strategies include trade sale, initial public offerings (IPO), and recapitalization., Private debt refers to various forms of debt provided by investors to private entities. Key private debt strategies include direct lending, mezzanine debt, and venture debt. Private debt also includes specialized strategies, such as collateralized loan obligation (CLOs), unitranche debt, real estate debt, and infrastructure debt.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2023/RR-2023-L1V5R15-private-capital-real-estate-infrastructure-natural-resources-hedge-funds.pdf,
Extensions of Multiple Regression,2024 Curriculum,CFA Program Level II,Quantitative Methods,The member should be able to: describe influence analysis and methods of detecting influential data points formulate and interpret a multiple regression model that includes qualitative independent variables formulate and interpret a logistic regression model,,"Two kinds of observations may potentially influence regression results: (1) a high-leverage point, an observation with an extreme value of an independent variable, and (2) an outlier, an observation with an extreme value of the dependent variable., A measure for identifying a high-leverage point is leverage. If leverage is greater than 3 ( k + 1 _ n ) , where k is the number of independent variables, then the observation is potentially influential., A measure for identifying an outlier is studentized residuals. If the studentized residual is greater than the critical value of the t-statistic with n – k – 2 degrees of freedom, then the observation is potentially influential., Cook’s distance, or Cook’s D (Di), is a metric for identifying influential data points. It measures how much the estimated values of the regression change if observation i is deleted. If D i > 2 √ _ k / n , then it is highly likely to be influential. An influence plot visually presents leverage, studentized residuals, and Cook’s D for each observation., Dummy, or indicator, variables represent qualitative independent variables and take a value of 1 (for true) or 0 (for false) to indicate whether a specific condition applies, such as whether a company belongs to a certain industry sector. To capture n possible categories, the model must include n – 1 dummy variables., An intercept dummy adds to or reduces the original intercept if a specific condition is met. When the intercept dummy is 1, the regression line shifts up or down parallel to the base regression line., A slope dummy allows for a changing slope if a specific condition is met. When the slope dummy is 1, the slope changes to (dj + bj) × Xj, where dj is the coefficient on the dummy variable and bj is the slope of Xj in the original regression line., A logistic regression model is one with a qualitative (i.e., categorical) dependent variable, so logistic regression is often used in binary classification problems, which are common in machine learning and neural networks., To estimate a logistic regression, the logistic transformation of the event probability (P) into the log odds, ln[P/(1 − P)], is applied, which linearizes the relation between the transformed dependent variable and the independent variables., Logistic regression coefficients are typically estimated using the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method, and slope coefficients are interpreted as the change in the log odds that the event happens per unit change in the independent variable, holding all other independent variables constant.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level2/level2a/RR_2024_L2V1R4_multiple_regression_extensions.pdf,
Pricing and Valuation of Forward Contracts and for an Underlying with Varying Maturities​,2024 Curriculum,CFA Program Level I,Derivatives,"The member should be able to: explain how the value and price of a forward contract are determined at initiation, during the life of the contract, and at expiration; and explain how forward rates are determined for an underlying with a term structure and describe their uses.","The member should be able to: explain how the value and price of a forward contract are determined at initiation, during the life of the contract, and at expiration; and explain how forward rates are determined for an underlying with a term structure and describe their uses.","A forward commitment price agreed upon at contract inception remains fixed and establishes the basis on which the underlying asset (or cash) will be exchanged in the future versus the spot price at maturity., For an underlying asset that does not generate cash flows, the value of a long forward commitment before expiration is equal to the current spot price of the underlying asset minus the present value of the forward price discounted at the risk-free rate. The reverse is true for a short forward commitment. Foreign exchange represents a special case in which the spot versus forward price is a function of the difference between risk-free rates across currencies., For an underlying asset with additional costs and benefits, the forward contract MTM value is adjusted by the sum of the present values of all additional cash flows through maturity., Underlying assets with a term structure, such as interest rates, have different rates or prices for different times-to-maturity. These zero or spot and forward rates are derived from coupon bonds and market reference rates and establish the building blocks of interest rate derivatives pricing., Implied forward rates represent a breakeven reinvestment rate linking short-dated and long-dated zero-coupon bonds over a specific period., A forward rate agreement (FRA) is a contract in which counterparties agree to apply a specific interest rate to a future period.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level1a/RR_2024_L1V5R5_v1.pdf,
Option Replication Using Put-Call Parity​,2023 Curriculum,CFA Program Level I,Derivatives,"The member should be able to: explain put–call parity for European options, and explain put–call forward parity for European options.","The member should be able to: explain put–call parity for European options, and explain put–call forward parity for European options.","Put–call parity establishes a relationship that allows the price of a call option to be derived from the price of a put option with the same underlying details and vice versa., Put–call parity holds for European options with the same exercise price and expiration date, representing a no-arbitrage relationship between put option, call option, underlying asset, and risk-free asset prices., If put–call parity does not hold, then riskless arbitrage profit opportunities may be available to investors., Put–call forward parity extends the put–call parity relationship to forward contracts given the equivalence of an underlying asset position and a long forward contract plus a risk-free bond., Under put–call forward parity, we may demonstrate that a purchased put option and a sold call option are equivalent to a long risk-free bond and short forward position, and a sold put and purchased call are equivalent to a long forward and short risk-free bond., Put–call parity may be applied beyond option-based strategies in finance—for example, to demonstrate that equityholders have a position equivalent to a purchased call option on the value of the firm with unlimited upside, while debtholders have a sold put option position on firm value with limited upside.",/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2023/RR-2023-L1V5R11-option-replication-using-put-call-parity.pdf,
