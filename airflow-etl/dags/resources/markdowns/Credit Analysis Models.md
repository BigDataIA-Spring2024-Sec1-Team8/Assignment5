## Summary

Three factors important to modeling credit risk are the expected exposure to default, the recovery rate, and the loss given default., These factors permit the calculation of a credit valuation adjustment that is subtracted from the (hypothetical) value of the bond, if it were default risk free, to get the bond’s fair value given its credit risk. The credit valuation adjustment is calculated as the sum of the present values of the expected loss for each period in the remaining life of the bond. Expected values are computed using risk-neutral probabilities, and discounting is done at the risk-free rates for the relevant maturities., The CVA captures investors’ compensation for bearing default risk. The compensation can also be expressed in terms of a credit spread., Credit scores and credit ratings are third-party evaluations of creditworthiness used in distinct markets., Analysts may use credit ratings and a transition matrix of probabilities to adjust a bond’s yield-to-maturity to reflect the probabilities of credit migration. Credit spread migration typically reduces expected return., Credit analysis models fall into two broad categories: structural models and reduced-form models., Structural models are based on an option perspective of the positions of the stakeholders of the company. Bondholders are viewed as owning the assets of the company; shareholders have call options on those assets., Reduced-form models seek to predict when a default may occur, but they do not explain the why as do structural models. Reduced-form models, unlike structural models, are based only on observable variables., When interest rates are assumed to be volatile, the credit risk of a bond can be estimated in an arbitrage-free valuation framework., The discount margin for floating-rate notes is similar to the credit spread for fixed-coupon bonds. The discount margin can also be calculated using an arbitrage-free valuation framework., Arbitrage-free valuation can be applied to judge the sensitivity of the credit spread to changes in credit risk parameters., The term structure of credit spreads depends on macro and micro factors., As it concerns macro factors, the credit spread curve tends to become steeper and widen in conditions of weak economic activity. Market supply and demand dynamics are important. The most frequently traded securities tend to determine the shape of this curve., Issuer- or industry-specific factors, such as the chance of a future leverage-decreasing event, can cause the credit spread curve to flatten or invert., When a bond is very likely to default, it often trades close to its recovery value at various maturities; moreover, the credit spread curve is less informative about the relationship between credit risk and maturity., For securitized debt, the characteristics of the asset portfolio themselves suggest the best approach for a credit analyst to take when deciding among investments. Important considerations include the relative concentration of assets and their similarity or heterogeneity as it concerns credit risk.

## Technical Note

**Summary:**

Expected exposure, loss given default, and probability of default determine a bond's credit valuation adjustment (CVA), which adjusts its value for default risk. Credit scores and ratings assess creditworthiness. Models of corporate credit risk include structural (option-based) and reduced-form (default prediction) approaches. Bond valuation considers credit risk parameters and results in a credit spread. Changes in credit spreads reflect changes in underlying risk. The term structure of credit spreads relates maturities to risk, influenced by macro factors and issuer characteristics. Credit analysis for securitized debt focuses on portfolio characteristics and risk concentration.
