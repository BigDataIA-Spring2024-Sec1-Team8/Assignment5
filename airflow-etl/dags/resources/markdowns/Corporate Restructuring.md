# Introduction

The member should be able to: explain types of corporate restructurings and issuers’ motivations for pursuing them; explain the initial evaluation of a corporate restructuring; demonstrate valuation methods for, and interpret valuations of, companies involved in corporate restructurings; demonstrate how corporate restructurings affect an issuer’s earnings per share (EPS); net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) ratio; and weighted average cost of capital; evaluate corporate investment actions, including equity investments, joint ventures, and acquisitions; evaluate corporate divestment actions, including sales and spin-offs; and evaluate cost and balance sheet restructurings.

## Summary

Corporate issuers seek to alter their destiny, as described by the corporate life cycle, by taking actions known as restructurings., Restructurings include investment actions that increase the size and scope of an issuer’s business, divestment actions that decrease size or scope, and restructuring actions that do not affect scope but improve performance., Investment actions include equity investments, joint ventures, and acquisitions. Investment actions are often made by issuers seeking growth, synergies, or undervalued targets., Divestment actions include sales and spin-offs and are made by issuers seeking to increase growth or profitability or reduce risk by shedding certain divisions and assets., Restructuring actions, including cost cutting, balance sheet restructurings, and reorganizations, do not change the size or scope of issuers but are aimed at improving returns on capital to historical or peer levels., The evaluation of a corporate restructuring is composed of four phases: initial evaluation, preliminary evaluation, modeling, and updating the investment thesis. The entire evaluation generally is done only for material restructurings., The initial evaluation of a corporate restructuring answers the following questions: What is happening? When is it happening? Is it material? And why is it happening?, Materiality is defined by both size and fit. One rule of thumb for size is that large actions are those that are greater than 10% of an issuer’s enterprise value (e.g., for an acquisition, consideration in excess of 10% of the acquirer’s preannouncement enterprise value). Fit refers to the alignment between the action and an analyst’s expectations for the issuer., The three common valuation methods for companies involved in corporate restructurings, during the preliminary valuation phase of the evaluation, are comparable company, comparable transaction, and premium paid analysis., Corporate restructurings must be modeled on the financial statements based on the situational specifics. Estimated financial statements that include the effect of a restructuring are known as pro forma financial statements., The weighted average cost of capital for an issuer is determined by the weights of different capital types and the constituent costs of capital. The costs of capital are influenced by both bottom-up and top-down drivers. Bottom-up drivers include stability, profitability, leverage, and asset specificity. Corporate restructurings affect the cost of capital by affecting these drivers.

## Technical Note

**Summary**

Corporate restructuring involves altering an issuer's trajectory through investments, divestments, or performance improvements. The initial evaluation of a restructuring considers its size, timing, materiality, and motivations. Valuation methods include comparable company, comparable transaction, and premium paid analysis. Corporate restructurings impact financial metrics such as EPS, debt-to-EBITDA ratio, and weighted average cost of capital. Investment actions (e.g., acquisitions) aim for growth or synergies, while divestment actions (e.g., sales) enhance profitability or reduce risk. Restructuring actions focus on improving returns without altering size or scope. Pro forma financial statements model the effects of restructuring, while the weighted average cost of capital considers capital sources and costs. Evaluating these actions requires understanding their impact on an issuer's financial health and alignment with expectations.
