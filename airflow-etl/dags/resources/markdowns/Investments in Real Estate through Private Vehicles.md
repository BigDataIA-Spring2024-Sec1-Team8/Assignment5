# Introduction



## Summary

Generally, three different valuation approaches are used by appraisers: income, cost, and sales comparison., The income approach includes direct capitalization and discounted cash flow methods. Both methods focus on net operating income as an input to the value of a property and indirectly or directly factor in expected growth., The cost approach estimates the value of a property based on adjusted replacement cost. This approach is typically used for unusual properties for which market comparables are difficult to obtain., The sales comparison approach estimates the value of a property based on what price comparable properties are selling for in the current market., When debt financing is used to purchase a property, additional ratios and returns calculated and interpreted by debt and equity investors include the loan-to-value ratio, the debt service coverage ratio, and leveraged and unleveraged internal rates of return.

## Learning Outcomes

The member should be able to: discuss the income, cost, and sales comparison approaches to valuing real estate properties compare the direct capitalization and discounted cash flow valuation methods estimate and interpret the inputs (for example, net operating income, capitalization rate, and discount rate) to the direct capitalization and discounted cash flow valuation methods calculate the value of a property using the direct capitalization and discounted cash flow valuation methods calculate and interpret financial ratios used to analyze and evaluate private real estate investments

## Technical Note

**Summary:**

Real estate valuation encompasses three approaches: income, cost, and sales comparison. The income approach utilizes Direct Capitalization (DC) and Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) methods, which consider net operating income and growth expectations. The cost approach estimates value based on adjusted replacement cost, often used for unique properties lacking comparable sales. The sales comparison approach compares prices of similar properties.

DC and DCF methods focus on net operating income, while the cost approach relies on replacement costs. The income and cost approaches both indirectly or directly incorporate growth estimates. The sales comparison approach relies on market comparables and current selling prices.

For debt-financed properties, additional ratios and returns are considered by investors, such as loan-to-value ratio, debt service coverage ratio, and leveraged/unleveraged internal rates of return.
