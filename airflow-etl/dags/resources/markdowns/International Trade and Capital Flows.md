## Summary

The benefits of trade include gains from exchange and specialization; gains from economies of scale as companies add new markets for their products; greater variety of products available to households and firms; and increased competition and more efficient allocation of resources., gains from exchange and specialization;, gains from economies of scale as companies add new markets for their products;, greater variety of products available to households and firms; and, increased competition and more efficient allocation of resources., A country has an absolute advantage in producing a good (or service) if it is able to produce that good at a lower absolute cost or use fewer resources in its production than its trading partner. A country has a comparative advantage in producing a good if its opportunity cost of producing that good is less than that of its trading partner., Even if a country does not have an absolute advantage in the production of any good, it can gain from trade by producing and exporting the good(s) in which it has a comparative advantage and importing good(s) in which it has a comparative disadvantage., In the Ricardian model of trade, comparative advantage and the pattern of trade are determined by differences in technology between countries. In the Heckscher–Ohlin model of trade, comparative advantage and the pattern of trade are determined by differences in factor endowments between countries. In reality, technology and factor endowments are complementary, not mutually exclusive, determinants of trade patterns., Trade barriers prevent the free flow of goods and services among countries. Governments impose trade barriers for various reasons including: to promote specific developmental objectives, to counteract certain imperfections in the functioning of markets, or to respond to problems facing their economies., For purposes of international trade policy and analysis, a small country is defined as one that cannot affect the world price of traded goods. A large country’s production and/or consumption decisions do alter the relative prices of trade goods., In a small country, trade barriers generate a net welfare loss arising from distortion of production and consumption decisions and the associated inefficient allocation of resources., Trade barriers can generate a net welfare gain in a large country if the gain from improving its terms of trade (higher export prices and lower import prices) more than offsets the loss from the distortion of resource allocations. However, the large country can only gain if it imposes an even larger welfare loss on its trading partner(s)., An import tariff and an import quota have the same effect on price, production, and trade. With a quota, however, some or all of the revenue that would be raised by the equivalent tariff is instead captured by foreign producers (or the foreign government) as quota rents. Thus, the welfare loss suffered by the importing country is generally greater with a quota., A voluntary export restraint is imposed by the exporting country. It has the same impact on the importing country as an import quota from which foreigners capture all of the quota rents., An export subsidy encourages firms to export their product rather than sell it in the domestic market. The distortion of production, consumption, and trade decisions generates a welfare loss. The welfare loss is greater for a large country because increased production and export of the subsidized product reduces its global price—that is, worsens the country’s terms of trade., Capital restrictions are defined as controls placed on foreigners’ ability to own domestic assets and/or domestic residents’ ability to own foreign assets. In contrast to trade restrictions, which limit the openness of goods markets, capital restrictions limit the openness of financial markets., A regional trading bloc is a group of countries who have signed an agreement to reduce and progressively eliminate barriers to trade and movement of factors of production among the members of the bloc. They may or may not have common trade barriers against those countries that are not members of the bloc. In a free trade area all barriers to the flow of goods and services among members are eliminated, but each country maintains its own polices against non-members. A customs union extends the FTA by not only allowing free movement of goods and services among members but also creating a common trade policy against non-members. A common market incorporates all aspects of a customs union and extends it by allowing free movement of factors of production among members. An economic union incorporates all aspects of a common market and requires common economic institutions and coordination of economic policies among members. Members of a monetary union adopt a common currency., They may or may not have common trade barriers against those countries that are not members of the bloc.

## Technical Note

**Summary**

Gross domestic product (GDP) measures the value of goods and services produced within a country's borders, while gross national product (GNP) includes income earned by nationals abroad. International trade offers benefits such as gains from specialization, economies of scale, and increased competition. Comparative advantage occurs when a country can produce a good at a lower opportunity cost than its trading partner, while absolute advantage refers to lower absolute production costs. The Ricardian model attributes comparative advantage to technological differences, while the Heckscher-Ohlin model focuses on factor endowments. Trade barriers include tariffs, quotas, and subsidies, which can have various economic implications. Trading blocs promote economic integration through reduced trade barriers and increased factor mobility. Capital restrictions control foreign ownership of domestic assets and vice versa. The balance of payments accounts track international transactions, and government policies can influence these flows. International organizations like the World Bank, IMF, and WTO support trade and economic development.
