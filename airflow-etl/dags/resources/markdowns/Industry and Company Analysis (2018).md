## Summary

Analysts can use a top-down, bottom-up, or a hybrid approach to forecasting income and expenses. Top-down approaches usually begin at the level of the overall economy. Bottom-up approaches begin at the level of the individual company or unit within the company (e.g., business segment). Time-series approaches are considered bottom-up, although time-series analysis can be a tool used in top-down approaches. Hybrid approaches include elements of topdown and bottom-up approaches., In a “growth relative to GDP growth” approach to forecasting revenue, the analyst forecasts the growth rate of nominal gross domestic product and industry and company growth relative to GDP growth., In a “market growth and market share” approach to forecasting revenue, the analyst combines forecasts of growth in particular markets with forecasts of a company’s market share in the individual markets., Operating margins that are positively correlated with sales provide evidence of economies of scale in an industry., Some balance sheet line items, such as retained earnings, flow directly from the income statement, whereas accounts receivable, accounts payable, and inventory are very closely linked to income statement projections., A common way to model working capital accounts is to use efficiency ratios., Return on invested capital (ROIC), defined as net operating profit less adjusted taxes divided by the difference between operating assets and operating liabilities, is an after-tax measure of the profitability of investing in a company. High and persistent levels of ROIC are often associated with having a competitive advantage., Competitive factors affect a company’s ability to negotiate lower input prices with suppliers and to raise prices for products and services. Porter’s five forces framework can be used as a basis for identifying such factors., Inflation (deflation) affects pricing strategy depending on industry structure, competitive forces, and the nature of consumer demand., When a technological development results in a new product that threatens to cannibalize demand for an existing product, a unit forecast for the new product combined with an expected cannibalization factor can be used to estimate the impact on future demand for the existing product., Factors influencing the choice of the explicit forecast horizon include the projected holding period, an investor’s average portfolio turnover, cyclicality of an industry, company specific factors, and employer preferences.

## Technical Note

**Summary**

Equity valuation models require forecasting inputs using top-down, bottom-up, or hybrid approaches. Top-down approaches start with overall economic forecasts, while bottom-up approaches start with individual company data. Hybrid approaches combine both methods.

Forecasting revenue involves "growth relative to GDP growth" or "market growth and market share" approaches. Analyzing operating margins and sales levels can indicate economies of scale within an industry.

Cost forecasting includes cost of goods sold, selling, general, and administrative costs, financing costs, and income taxes. Balance sheet modeling considers linkages between income statement projections and accounts receivable, payable, and inventory.

Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures profitability and can indicate competitive advantage. Competitive factors influence pricing and costs, and Porter's five forces analysis helps identify these factors.

Inflation and deflation impact forecasting, and technological developments can affect demand, prices, costs, and margins. The choice of forecast horizon depends on factors like holding period, industry cyclicality, and employer preferences.

Beyond the forecast horizon, analysts must consider qualitative analysis to supplement quantitative projections. Sales-based pro forma company models demonstrate the development of financial statements based on forecasted sales.
