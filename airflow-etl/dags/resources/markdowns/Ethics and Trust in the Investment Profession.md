**Summary**

Ethics are moral principles that guide behavior and decision-making. A profession is defined by its ethical code, which establishes norms and expectations for its members. Investment management requires high ethical standards to maintain trust and protect investors. Professionalism in investment management involves adhering to ethical codes, acting with integrity, and putting clients' interests first. Ethical behavior can be challenged by conflicts of interest, biases, and personal values. It is important to distinguish between ethical and legal standards, as ethical standards may exceed legal requirements. Ethical decision-making involves identifying potential ethical issues, considering stakeholder interests, and weighing alternative courses of action based on ethical principles. By adhering to ethical codes and practicing professionalism, investment professionals help to uphold the integrity of the profession and protect investors.
