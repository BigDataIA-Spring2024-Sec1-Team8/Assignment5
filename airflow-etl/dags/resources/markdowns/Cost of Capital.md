# Introduction

The member should be able to: calculate and interpret the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of a company; describe how taxes affect the cost of capital from different capital sources; calculate and interpret the cost of debt capital using the yield-to-maturity approach and the debt-rating approach; calculate and interpret the cost of noncallable, nonconvertible preferred stock; calculate and interpret the cost of equity capital using the capital asset pricing model approach and the bond yield plus risk premium approach; explain and demonstrate beta estimation for public companies, thinly traded public companies, and nonpublic companies; explain and demonstrate the correct treatment of flotation costs.

## Summary

The weighted average cost of capital is a weighted average of the after-tax marginal costs of each source of capital: WACC = wdrd(1 – t) + wprp + were, The before-tax cost of debt is generally estimated by either the yield-to-maturity method or the bond rating method., The yield-to-maturity method of estimating the before-tax cost of debt uses the familiar bond valuation equation. Assuming semi-annual coupon payments, the equation is

## Technical Note

**Technical Note: Calculating and Interpreting WACC and Cost of Capital**

**Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)**

* WACC represents the average cost of a company's mix of different capital sources, weighted by their proportions.
* Formula: WACC = wdrd(1 – t) + wprp + were, where wd, wpr, and were represent the weights of debt, preferred stock, and equity, respectively; rd is the debt cost; rp is the preferred stock cost; and re is the equity cost; and t is the corporate tax rate.

**Cost of Debt Capital**

* Can be estimated using the yield-to-maturity (YTM) approach or the debt-rating approach.
* YTM approach uses the bond valuation equation:

```
P = FV / (1 + YTM/2)^n
```

* Debt-rating approach uses published tables to determine the cost of debt based on the company's debt rating.

**Cost of Preferred Stock**

* Noncallable, nonconvertible preferred stock has a fixed dividend rate, so its cost is simply:

```
Cost of preferred stock = Dividend rate / Market price
```

**Cost of Equity Capital**

* Capital asset pricing model (CAPM) approach:

```
re = rf + β * (rm - rf)
```

* Bond yield plus risk premium (BYPRP) approach:

```
re = rd + RP
```

* Beta estimation methods: regression analysis for public companies, industry averages for thinly traded public companies, and expert judgment for nonpublic companies.

**Flotation Costs**

* Fees associated with issuing new securities.
* Flotation costs should be capitalized and amortized over the life of the security.
