## Summary

Differences between the recognition of revenue and expenses for tax and accounting purposes may result in taxable income differing from accounting profit. The discrepancy is a result of different treatments of certain income and expenditure items., The tax base of an asset is the amount that will be deductible for tax purposes as an expense in the calculation of taxable income as the company expenses the tax basis of the asset. If the economic benefit will not be taxable, the tax base of the asset will be equal to the carrying amount of the asset., The tax base of a liability is the carrying amount of the liability less any amounts that will be deductible for tax purposes in the future. With respect to revenue received in advance, the tax base of such a liability is the carrying amount less any amount of the revenue that will not be taxable in the future., Temporary differences arise from recognition of differences in the tax base and carrying amount of assets and liabilities. The creation of a deferred tax asset or liability as a result of a temporary difference will only be allowed if the difference reverses itself at some future date and to the extent that it is expected that the balance sheet item will create future economic benefits for the company., Permanent differences result in a difference in tax and financial reporting of revenue (expenses) that will not be reversed at some future date. Because it will not be reversed at a future date, these differences do not constitute temporary differences and do not give rise to a deferred tax asset or liability., Current taxes payable or recoverable are based on the applicable tax rates on the balance sheet date of an entity; in contrast, deferred taxes should be measured at the tax rate that is expected to apply when the asset is realized or the liability settled., All unrecognized deferred tax assets and liabilities must be reassessed on the appropriate balance sheet date and measured against their probable future economic benefit., Deferred tax assets must be assessed for their prospective recoverability. If it is probable that they will not be recovered at all or partly, the carrying amount should be reduced. Under US GAAP, this is done through the use of a valuation allowance.

## Technical Note

**Summary:**

- Accounting profit and taxable income differ due to variations in revenue and expense recognition for tax and accounting purposes.
- Deferred tax assets/liabilities arise from temporary differences between accounting and tax bases of assets/liabilities.
- Current taxes are based on current tax rates, while deferred taxes use expected future rates.
- The tax base of an asset is the deductible amount for tax purposes, while the tax base of a liability is its carrying amount minus future tax deductions.
- Temporary differences reverse future, creating deferred assets/liabilities. Permanent differences do not, and thus do not impact deferred taxes.
- Deferred tax assets must be assessed for recoverability and may be reduced by a valuation allowance under GAAP.
- Changes in tax rates impact financial statements and ratios, and analysts must consider this effect.
- Deferred tax disclosures provide insights into the company's tax position and future cash flows.
- IFRS and GAAP have differences in income tax accounting, including the treatment of deferred taxes.
