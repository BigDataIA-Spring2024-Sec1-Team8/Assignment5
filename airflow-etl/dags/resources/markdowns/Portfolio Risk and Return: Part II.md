# Introduction

The member should be able to: describe the implications of combining a risk-free asset with a portfolio of risky assets; explain the capital allocation line (CAL) and the capital market line (CML); explain systematic and nonsystematic risk, including why an investor should not expect to receive additional return for bearing nonsystematic risk; explain return generating models (including the market model) and their uses; calculate and interpret beta; explain the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), including its assumptions, and the security market line (SML); calculate and interpret the expected return of an asset using the CAPM; describe and demonstrate applications of the CAPM and the SML; calculate and interpret the Sharpe ratio, Treynor ratio, M 2, and Jensen’s alpha.

## Summary

The capital market line is a special case of the capital allocation line, where the efficient portfolio is the market portfolio., Obtaining a unique optimal risky portfolio is not possible if investors are permitted to have heterogeneous beliefs because such beliefs will result in heterogeneous asset prices., Investors can leverage their portfolios by borrowing money and investing in the market., Systematic risk is the risk that affects the entire market or economy and is not diversifiable., Nonsystematic risk is local and can be diversified away by combining assets with low correlations., Beta risk, or systematic risk, is priced and earns a return, whereas nonsystematic risk is not priced., The expected return of an asset depends on its beta risk and can be computed using the CAPM, which is given by E(Ri) = Rf + βi[E(Rm) – Rf ]., The security market line is an implementation of the CAPM and applies to all securities, whether they are efficient or not., Expected return from the CAPM can be used for making capital budgeting decisions., Portfolios can be evaluated by several CAPM-based measures, such as the Sharpe ratio, the Treynor ratio, M2, and Jensen’s alpha., The SML can assist in security selection and optimal portfolio construction.

## Technical Note

**Technical Note on the Capital Allocation Line (CAL) and the Capital Market Line (CML)**

**Combining Risk-Free and Risky Assets**

Combining a risk-free asset with a portfolio of risky assets improves the risk-return balance, allowing investors to create a more diversified and efficient portfolio.

**Capital Allocation Line (CAL)**

The CAL represents the optimal combination of risky and risk-free assets. It slopes upward, indicating that as the proportion of risky assets increases, so does the expected return and risk.

**Capital Market Line (CML)**

The CML is a special case of the CAL where the risky asset is the market portfolio. It represents the efficient combination of all possible portfolios, including all risky and risk-free portfolios.

**Systematic and Nonsystematic Risk**

* **Systematic risk:** Market-wide risk that cannot be diversified away.
* **Nonsystematic risk:** Asset-specific risk that can be reduced through diversification. Investors are not compensated for bearing nonsystematic risk.

**Beta and Return Generating Models**

* Beta measures systematic risk.
* The market model is a simple regression model used to estimate beta.

**Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)**

* The CAPM explains the relationship between expected return and systematic risk.
* Expected return = Risk-free rate + Beta x Market risk premium
* Assumptions: Rational investors, no transaction costs, and perfect information.

**Security Market Line (SML)**

* The SML is a graphical representation of the CAPM that shows the relationship between expected return and beta for all securities.
* It provides a benchmark for evaluating the risk and return of individual assets.

**Performance Measures**

* Sharpe ratio: Measures risk-adjusted return.
* Treynor ratio: Measures excess return per unit of systematic risk.
* M2: Measures portfolio performance relative to the CML.
* Jensen's alpha: Measures excess return relative to the CAPM-predicted return.
