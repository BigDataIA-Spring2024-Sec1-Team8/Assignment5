# Introduction

Market Efficiency and Active Manager Selection The chief investment officer (CIO) of a major university endowment fund has listed eight steps in the active manager selection process that can be applied both to traditional investments (e.g., common equity and fixed-income securities) and to alternative investments (e.g., private equity, hedge funds, and real assets). The first step specified is the evaluation of market opportunity: What is the opportunity and why is it there? To answer this question, we start by studying capital markets and the types of managers operating within those markets. We identify market inefficiencies and try to understand their causes, such as regulatory structures or behavioral biases. We can rule out many broad groups of managers and strategies by simply determining that the degree of market inefficiency necessary to support a strategy is implausible. Importantly, we consider the past history of active returns meaningless unless we understand why markets will allow those active returns to continue into the future. The CIO’s description underscores the importance of not assuming that past active returns that might be found in a historical dataset will repeat themselves in the future. refer to returns earned by strategies that do not assume that all information is fully reflected in market prices.

## Summary

The efficiency of a market is affected by the number of market participants and depth of analyst coverage, information availability, and limits to trading., There are three forms of efficient markets, each based on what is considered to be the information used in determining asset prices. In the weak form, asset prices fully reflect all market data, which refers to all past price and trading volume information. In the semi-strong form, asset prices reflect all publicly known and available information. In the strong form, asset prices fully reflect all information, which includes both public and private information., Intrinsic value refers to the true value of an asset, whereas market value refers to the price at which an asset can be bought or sold. When markets are efficient, the two should be the same or very close. But when markets are not efficient, the two can diverge significantly., Most empirical evidence supports the idea that securities markets in developed countries are semi-strong-form efficient; however, empirical evidence does not support the strong form of the efficient market hypothesis., A number of anomalies have been documented that contradict the notion of market efficiency, including the size anomaly, the January anomaly, and the winners–losers anomalies. In most cases, however, contradictory evidence both supports and refutes the anomaly., Behavioral finance uses human psychology, such as behavioral biases, in an attempt to explain investment decisions. Whereas behavioral finance is helpful in understanding observed decisions, a market can still be considered efficient even if market participants exhibit seemingly irrational behaviors, such as herding.

## Learning Outcomes

The member should be able to: The candidate should be able to: describe market efficiency and related concepts, including their importance to investment practitioners; distinguish between market value and intrinsic value; explain factors that affect a market’s efficiency; contrast weak-form, semi-strong-form, and strong-form market efficiency; explain the implications of each form of market efficiency for fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and the choice between active and passive portfolio management; describe market anomalies; describe behavioral finance and its potential relevance to understanding market anomalies.

## Technical Note

**Summary**

Market efficiency describes the ability of market prices to reflect available information. It affects portfolio management choices, with implications for active and passive strategies. Market efficiency exists in three forms: weak-form (prices reflect past data), semi-strong-form (prices reflect public information), and strong-form (prices reflect all information). Intrinsic value represents the true worth of an asset, while market value reflects its current trading price. Market anomalies are deviations from predicted market behavior, challenging market efficiency. Behavioral finance incorporates human psychology into investment decision-making. Despite anomalies, empirical evidence supports the semi-strong-form efficiency of developed securities markets. Understanding market efficiency and its implications is crucial for investment practitioners, including those involved in active manager selection.
