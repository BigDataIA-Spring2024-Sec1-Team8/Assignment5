## Summary

Residual income is calculated as net income minus a deduction for the cost of equity capital. The deduction, called the equity charge, is equal to equity capital multiplied by the required rate of return on equity (the cost of equity capital in percent)., Economic value added (EVA) is a commercial implementation of the residual income concept. EVA = NOPAT − (C% × TC), where NOPAT is net operating profit after taxes, C% is the percent cost of capital, and TC is total capital., Residual income models (including commercial implementations) are used not only for equity valuation but also to measure internal corporate performance and for determining executive compensation., We can forecast per-share residual income as forecasted earnings per share minus the required rate of return on equity multiplied by beginning book value per share. Alternatively, per-share residual income can be forecasted as beginning book value per share multiplied by the difference between forecasted ROE and the required rate of return on equity., In the residual income model, the intrinsic value of a share of common stock is the sum of book value per share and the present value of expected future per-share residual income. In the residual income model, the equivalent mathematical expressions for intrinsic value of a common stock are V 0 = B 0 + ∑ t = 1 ∞ RI t ( 1 + r ) t = B 0 + ∑ t = 1 ∞ E t − r B t − 1 ( 1 + r ) t = B 0 + ∑ t = 1 ∞ ( ROE t − r ) B t − 1 ( 1 + r ) t where

## Technical Note

**Summary:**

* Residual income measures the excess of net income over the cost of equity capital.
* Economic value added (EVA) is a commercial implementation of residual income.
* Residual income models are used for equity valuation, performance measurement, and executive compensation.
* The intrinsic value of a stock using the residual income model is the sum of book value and the present value of future residual income.
* Fundamental determinants of residual income include net income, book value, and cost of equity capital.
* The justified price-to-book ratio is based on forecasted fundamentals and the relationship between residual income valuation.
* Residual income models can be single-stage or multistage, with assumptions about future growth rates.
* Implied growth rates in residual income can be calculated from market price-to-book ratios and required returns.
* Continuing residual income is an estimate of residual income at the forecast horizon, considering company and industry prospects.
* Residual income models have strengths (e.g., simplicity, focus on excess returns) and weaknesses (e.g., reliance on accounting assumptions, sensitivity to growth estimates).
