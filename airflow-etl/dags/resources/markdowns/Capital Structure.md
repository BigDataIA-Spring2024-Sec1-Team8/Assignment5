# Introduction

The member should be able to: explain the Modigliani–Miller propositions regarding capital structure; explain the effects on costs of capital and capital structure decisions of taxes, financial distress, agency costs, and asymmetric information; explain factors an analyst should consider in evaluating the effect of capital structure policy on valuation; describe international differences in the use of financial leverage, factors that explain these differences, and implications of these differences for investment analysis.

## Summary

The goal of the capital structure decision is to determine the financial leverage that maximizes the value of the company (or minimizes the weighted average cost of capital)., In the Modigliani and Miller theory developed without taxes, capital structure is irrelevant and has no effect on company value., The deductibility of interest lowers the cost of debt and the cost of capital for the company as a whole. Adding the tax shield provided by debt to the Modigliani and Miller framework suggests that the optimal capital structure is all debt., In the Modigliani and Miller propositions with and without taxes, increasing a company’s relative use of debt in the capital structure increases the risk for equity providers and, hence, the cost of equity capital., When there are bankruptcy costs, a high debt ratio increases the risk of bankruptcy., Using more debt in a company’s capital structure reduces the net agency costs of equity., The costs of asymmetric information increase as more equity is used versus debt, suggesting the pecking order theory of leverage in which new equity issuance is the least preferred method of raising capital., According to the static trade-off theory of capital structure, in choosing a capital structure, a company balances the value of the tax benefit from deductibility of interest with the present value of the costs of financial distress. At the optimal target capital structure, the incremental tax shield benefit is exactly offset by the incremental costs of financial distress., A company may identify its target capital structure, but its capital structure at any point in time may not be equal to its target for many reasons., Many companies have goals for maintaining a certain credit rating, and these goals are influenced by the relative costs of debt financing among the different rating classes., In evaluating a company’s capital structure, the financial analyst must look at such factors as the capital structure of the company over time, the business risk of the company, the capital structure of competitors that have similar business risk, and company-specific factors (e.g., the quality of corporate governance, which may affect agency costs)., Good corporate governance and accounting transparency should lower the net agency costs of equity., When comparing capital structures of companies in different countries, an analyst must consider a variety of characteristics that might differ and affect both the typical capital structure and the debt maturity structure. The major characteristics fall into three categories: institutional and legal environment, financial markets and banking sector, and macroeconomic environment.

## Technical Note

**Summary**

* **Modigliani-Miller Propositions:** Capital structure is irrelevant in the absence of taxes and transaction costs.
* **Taxes:** Deductibility of interest lowers the cost of debt and weighted average cost of capital (WACC); optimal capital structure with taxes is 100% debt.
* **Financial Distress:** High debt ratios increase bankruptcy risk, offsetting tax benefits.
* **Agency Costs:** Debt can reduce net agency costs of equity.
* **Asymmetric Information:** Equity is more expensive than debt due to information asymmetry, leading to pecking order theory of leverage.
* **Static Trade-Off Theory:** Balancing tax shields against financial distress costs determines optimal capital structure.
* **Corporate Governance:** Good governance and transparency can reduce agency costs.
* **International Differences:** Capital structures vary globally due to institutional, financial, and macroeconomic factors.
* **Analyst Evaluation:** Consider company-specific factors, business risk, and competitor capital structures.
* **Goal:** Maximize firm value or minimize WACC through appropriate capital structure.
