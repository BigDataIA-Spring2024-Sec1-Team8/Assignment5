# Introduction

The candidate should be able to: calculate and interpret residual income, economic value added, and market value added; describe the uses of residual income models; calculate the intrinsic value of a common stock using the residual income model and compare value recognition in residual income and other present value models; explain fundamental determinants of residual income; explain the relation between residual income valuation and the justified price-to-book ratio based on forecasted fundamentals; calculate and interpret the intrinsic value of a common stock using single-stage (constant-growth) and multistage residual income models; calculate the implied growth rate in residual income, given the market price-to-book ratio and an estimate of the required rate of return on equity; explain continuing residual income and justify an estimate of continuing residual income at the forecast horizon, given company and industry prospects; compare residual income models to dividend discount and free cash flow models; explain strengths and weaknesses of residual income models and justify the selection of a residual income model to value a company’s common stock; describe accounting issues in applying residual income models; evaluate whether a stock is overvalued, fairly valued, or undervalued based on a residual income model.

## Technical Note

**Summary (within 10 sentences):**

- **Residual Income (RI)** is a measure of the excess earnings available to shareholders after deducting the cost of capital.

- **Economic Value Added (EVA)** is a modification of RI that adjusts for non-cash charges.

- **Market Value Added (MVA)** is a variation of EVA that uses market values instead of book values.

- RI models are used to estimate the intrinsic value of stocks and compare it to the market value.

- **Fundamental Determinants of RI** include operating efficiency, asset turnover, and financial leverage.

- The **Justified Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio** is the ratio of the market value of equity to its book value, based on forecasted fundamentals.

- **Single-Stage RI Models** assume constant growth in RI, while **Multistage RI Models** allow for varying growth rates over different periods.

- **Continuing RI** is the RI expected to occur beyond the explicit forecast period.

- RI models differ from dividend discount and free cash flow models in their focus on residual income and their consideration of accounting issues.

- **Strengths of RI Models** include their theoretical basis and their ability to incorporate growth and risk. **Weaknesses** include potential data biases and the need for subjective inputs.
