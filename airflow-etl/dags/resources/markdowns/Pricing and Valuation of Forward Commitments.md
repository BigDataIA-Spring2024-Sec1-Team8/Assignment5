## Summary

The arbitrageur would rather have more money than less and abides by two fundamental rules: Do not use your own money, and do not take any price risk., The no-arbitrage approach is used for the pricing and valuation of forward commitments and is built on the key concept of the law of one price, which states that if two investments have the same future cash flows, regardless of what happens in the future, these two investments should have the same current price., Throughout this reading, the following key assumptions are made: Replicating and offsetting instruments are identifiable and investable. Market frictions are nil. Short selling is allowed with full use of proceeds. Borrowing and lending are available at a known risk-free rate., Replicating and offsetting instruments are identifiable and investable., Market frictions are nil., Short selling is allowed with full use of proceeds., Borrowing and lending are available at a known risk-free rate., Carry arbitrage models used for forward commitment pricing and valuation are based on the no-arbitrage approach., With forward commitments, there is a distinct difference between pricing and valuation. Pricing involves the determination of the appropriate fixed price or rate, and valuation involves the determination of the contract’s current value expressed in currency units., Forward commitment pricing results in determining a price or rate such that the forward contract value is equal to zero., Using the carry arbitrage model, the forward contract price (F0) is: F0 = FV(S0) = S0(1 + r)T (assuming annual compounding, r) F 0 = FV ( S 0 ) = S 0 exp r c T (assuming continuous compounding, rc ), The key forward commitment pricing equations with carry costs (CC) and carry benefits (CB) are: F0 = FV[S0 + CC0 – CB0] (with discrete compounding) F 0 = S 0 exp ( r c + CC − CB ) T (with continuous compounding)

## Technical Note

**Summary:**

The carry arbitrage model is used to price and value forward commitments without and with underlying cashflows. The no-arbitrage approach ensures that two investments with identical future cash flows should have the same current price. Key assumptions include identifiable replicating instruments, nil market frictions, and availability of borrowing and lending at a known risk-free rate. Forward commitment pricing involves determining a price or rate that equates the forward contract value to zero. With carry costs and benefits, the pricing equations are: F0 = FV[S0 + CC0 – CB0] (discrete compounding) and F0 = S0 exp ( rc + CC − CB ) T (continuous compounding). Equity, interest rate, fixed-income, interest rate swaps, currency swaps, and equity swaps are all valued using the carry arbitrage model and no-arbitrage principles.
