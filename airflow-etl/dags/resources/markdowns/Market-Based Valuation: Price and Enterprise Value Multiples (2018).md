# Introduction

The candidate should be able to: distinguish between the method of comparables and the method based on forecasted fundamentals as approaches to using price multiples in valuation, and explain economic rationales for each approach; calculate and interpret a justified price multiple; describe rationales for and possible drawbacks to using alternative price multiples and dividend yield in valuation; calculate and interpret alternative price multiples and dividend yield; calculate and interpret underlying earnings, explain methods of normalizing earnings per share (EPS), and calculate normalized EPS; explain and justify the use of earnings yield (E/P); describe fundamental factors that influence alternative price multiples and dividend yield; calculate and interpret the justified price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), price-to-book ratio (P/B), and price-to-sales ratio (P/S) for a stock, based on forecasted fundamentals; calculate and interpret a predicted P/E, given a cross-sectional regression on fundamentals, and explain limitations to the cross-sectional regression methodology; evaluate a stock by the method of comparables and explain the importance of fundamentals in using the method of comparables; calculate and interpret the P/E-to-growth ratio (PEG) and explain its use in relative valuation; calculate and explain the use of price multiples in determining terminal value in a multistage discounted cash flow (DCF) model; explain alternative definitions of cash flow used in price and enterprise value (EV) multiples and describe limitations of each definition; calculate and interpret EV multiples and evaluate the use of EV/EBITDA; explain sources of differences in cross-border valuation comparisons; describe momentum indicators and their use in valuation; explain the use of the arithmetic mean, the harmonic mean, the weighted harmonic mean, and the median to describe the central tendency of a group of multiples; revaluate whether a stock is overvalued, fairly valued, or undervalued based on comparisons of multiples.

## Technical Note

**Summary:**

This technical note summarizes the key points of valuing companies using price multiples, including the methods of comparables and forecasted fundamentals. It explains the calculation and interpretation of justified price multiples, alternative price multiples, dividend yield, underlying earnings, and normalized EPS. The note also covers fundamental factors influencing price multiples, cross-sectional regression for predicting P/E, the use of price multiples in determining terminal value, and alternative definitions of cash flow used in price and enterprise value multiples. Additionally, the note discusses sources of differences in cross-border valuation comparisons, momentum indicators, measures of central tendency, and the reevaluation of stock value based on multiple comparisons.
