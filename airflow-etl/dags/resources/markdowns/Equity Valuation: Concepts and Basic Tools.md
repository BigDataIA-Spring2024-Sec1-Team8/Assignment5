# Introduction

The member should be able to: evaluate whether a security, given its current market price and a value estimate, is overvalued, fairly valued, or undervalued by the market; describe major categories of equity valuation models; describe regular cash dividends, extra dividends, stock dividends, stock splits, reverse stock splits, and share repurchases; describe dividend payment chronology; explain the rationale for using present value models to value equity and describe the dividend discount and free-cash-flow-to-equity models; calculate the intrinsic value of a non-callable, non-convertible preferred stock; calculate and interpret the intrinsic value of an equity security based on the Gordon (constant) growth dividend discount model or a two-stage dividend discount model, as appropriate; identify characteristics of companies for which the constant growth or a multistage dividend discount model is appropriate; explain the rationale for using price multiples to value equity, how the price to earnings multiple relates to fundamentals, and the use of multiples based on comparables; calculate and interpret the following multiples: price to earnings, price to an estimate of operating cash flow, price to sales, and price to book value; describe enterprise value multiples and their use in estimating equity value; describe asset-based valuation models and their use in estimating equity value; explain advantages and disadvantages of each category of valuation model.

## Summary

An analyst estimating intrinsic value is implicitly questioning the market’s estimate of value., If the estimated value exceeds the market price, the analyst infers the security is undervalued. If the estimated value equals the market price, the analyst infers the security is fairly valued. If the estimated value is less than the market price, the analyst infers the security is overvalued. Because of the uncertainties involved in valuation, an analyst may require that value estimates differ markedly from market price before concluding that a misvaluation exists., Analysts often use more than one valuation model because of concerns about the applicability of any particular model and the variability in estimates that result from changes in inputs., Three major categories of equity valuation models are present value, multiplier, and asset-based valuation models., Present value models estimate value as the present value of expected future benefits., Multiplier models estimate intrinsic value based on a multiple of some fundamental variable., Asset-based valuation models estimate value based on the estimated value of assets and liabilities., The choice of model will depend upon the availability of information to input into the model and the analyst’s confidence in both the information and the appropriateness of the model., Companies distribute cash to shareholders using dividend payments and share repurchases., Regular cash dividends are a key input to dividend valuation models., Key dates in dividend chronology are the declaration date, ex-dividend date, holder-of-record date, and payment date., In the dividend discount model, value is estimated as the present value of expected future dividends., In the free cash flow to equity model, value is estimated as the present value of expected future free cash flow to equity., The Gordon growth model, a simple DDM, estimates value as D 1/(r – g)., The two stage dividend discount model estimates value as the sum of the present values of dividends over a short-term period of high growth and the present value of the terminal value at the end of the period of high growth. The terminal value is estimated using the Gordon growth model., The choice of dividend model is based upon the patterns assumed with respect to future dividends., Multiplier models typically use multiples of the form: P/ measure of fundamental variable or EV/ measure of fundamental variable., Multiples can be based upon fundamentals or comparables., Asset-based valuations models estimate value of equity as the value of the assets less the value of liabilities.

## Technical Note

**Summary**

An analyst's value estimate influences their assessment of a security's market valuation (overvalued, fairly valued, or undervalued). To determine value, three main types of models are employed: present value, multiplier, and asset-based. Present value models (e.g., dividend discount and free-cash-flow-to-equity) estimate future cash flows' present value. Multiplier models link intrinsic value to fundamental metrics (e.g., price-to-earnings). Asset-based models estimate value based on asset and liability values. Dividend payments and share repurchases are common methods for companies to distribute cash to shareholders. The dividend discount model and two-stage dividend discount model incorporate dividends into valuation. The choice of model depends on specific information and model appropriateness. Each category of valuation model has unique advantages and disadvantages.
