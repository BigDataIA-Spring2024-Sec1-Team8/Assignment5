The member should be able to: describe “fintech;” describe Big Data, artificial intelligence, and machine learning; describe fintech applications to investment management; describe financial applications of distributed ledger technology.

## Summary

The term “fintech” refers to technological innovation in the design and delivery of financial services and products., Areas of fintech development include the analysis of large datasets, analytical techniques, automated trading, automated advice, and financial record keeping., Big Data is characterized by the three Vs—volume, velocity, and variety—and includes both traditional and nontraditional (or alternative) datasets., Among the main sources of alternative data are data generated by individuals, business processes, and sensors., AI computer systems are capable of performing tasks that traditionally required human intelligence at levels comparable (or superior) to those of human beings., ML seeks to extract knowledge from large amounts of data by “learning” from known examples and then generating structure or predictions. Simply put, ML algorithms aim to “find the pattern, apply the pattern.” The main types of ML include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and deep learning., Natural language processing (NLP) is an application of text analytics that uses insight into the structure of human language to analyze and interpret text- and voice-based data., Robo-advisory services are providing automated advisory services to increasing numbers of retail investors. Services include asset allocation, portfolio optimization, trade execution, rebalancing, and tax strategies., Big Data and ML techniques could provide insights into real-time and changing market circumstances to identify weakening or adverse trends in advance, allowing for improved risk management and investment decision making., Algorithmic traders use automated trading programs to determine when, where, and how to trade an order on the basis of specified rules and market conditions. Benefits include speed of executions, lower trading costs, and anonymity., Blockchain and DLT might offer a new way to store, record, and track financial assets on a secure, distributed basis. Applications include cryptocurrencies and tokenization. Additionally, DLT could bring efficiencies to post-trade and compliance processes through automation, smart contracts, and identity verification.
