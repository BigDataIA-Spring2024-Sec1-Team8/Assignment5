# Introduction

The member should be able to: explain how the concepts of arbitrage and replication are used in pricing derivatives, and explain the difference between the spot and expected future price of an underlying and the cost of carry associated with holding the underlying asset.

## Summary

Forward commitments are an alternative means of taking a long or short position in an underlying asset. A link between forward prices and spot prices exists to prevent investors from taking advantage of arbitrage opportunities across cash and derivative instruments., A forward commitment may be replicated with a long or short spot position in the underlying asset and borrowing or lending at a risk-free rate. Investors can recreate a variety of positions by using appropriate combinations of spot, forward, and risk-free positions., The risk-free rate provides a fundamental link between spot and forward prices for underlying assets with no additional costs or benefits of ownership., The cost of carry is the net of the costs and benefits related to owning an underlying asset for a specific period and must be factored into the difference between the spot price and a forward price of a specific underlying asset., The cost of carry may include costs, such as storage and insurance for physical commodities, or benefits of ownership, such as dividends for stocks and interest for bonds. Foreign exchange represents a special case in which the cost of carry is the interest rate differential between two currencies., Forward prices may be greater than or less than the underlying spot price, depending on the specific cost of carry associated with owning the underlying asset.

## Technical Note

**Technical Note**

**Arbitrage and Replication in Derivative Pricing**

**Key Points:**

* **Arbitrage:** Exploiting price discrepancies between cash and derivative instruments to generate risk-free profit.
* **Replication:** Creating a synthetic position in a derivative using a combination of spot, forward, and risk-free positions.

**Spot and Forward Prices**

* **Spot price:** Current market price of an underlying asset.
* **Forward price:** Price agreed upon for future delivery of an underlying asset.
* **Cost of carry:** Net cost/benefit associated with holding an underlying asset (storage, dividends, interest).

**Relationship Between Spot and Forward Prices**

* Risk-free rate provides a link between spot and forward prices, preventing arbitrage opportunities.
* Cost of carry explains the difference between spot and expected future price.

**Forward Price Formation**

* Forward price = spot price * e^(r * t)
    * r = risk-free rate
    * t = time to maturity

**Special Case: Foreign Exchange**

* Cost of carry is the interest rate differential between two currencies.
* Forward exchange rates can be higher or lower than spot rates, depending on the interest rate differential.

**Conclusion:**

Understanding arbitrage, replication, and the cost of carry is crucial for pricing derivatives. These concepts help explain the relationship between spot and forward prices and ensure market efficiency.
