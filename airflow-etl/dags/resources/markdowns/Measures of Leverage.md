# Introduction

The member should be able to: define and explain leverage, business risk, sales risk, operating risk, and financial risk and classify a risk; calculate and interpret the degree of operating leverage, the degree of financial leverage, and the degree of total leverage; analyze the effect of financial leverage on a company’s net income and return on equity; calculate the breakeven quantity of sales and determine the company's net income at various sales levels; calculate and interpret the operating breakeven quantity of sales.

## Summary

Leverage is the use of fixed costs in a company’s cost structure. Business risk is the risk associated with operating earnings and reflects both sales risk (uncertainty with respect to the price and quantity of sales) and operating risk (the risk related to the use of fixed costs in operations). Financial risk is the risk associated with how a company finances its operations (i.e., the split between equity and debt financing of the business)., The degree of operating leverage (DOL) is the ratio of the percentage change in operating income to the percentage change in units sold. We can use the following formula to measure the degree of operating leverage: DOL=Q(P−V)Q(P−V)−F, The degree of financial leverage (DFL) is the percentage change in net income for a one percent change in operating income. We can use the following formula to measure the degree of financial leverage: DFL=[Q(P−V)−F](1−t)[Q(P−V)−F−C](1−t)=[Q(P−V)−F][Q(P−V)−F−C], The degree of total leverage (DTL) is a measure of the sensitivity of net income to changes in unit sales, which is equivalent to DTL = DOL × DFL., The breakeven point, QBE, is the number of units produced and sold at which the company’s net income is zero, which we calculate as QBE=F+CP−V, The operating breakeven point, QOBE, is the number of units produced and sold at which the company’s operating income is zero, which we calculate as

## Technical Note

**Summary**

Leverage refers to the use of fixed costs in a company's cost structure. Business risk encompasses sales risk (uncertainty in sales price and quantity) and operating risk (related to fixed costs). Financial risk arises from financing operations through debt.

The degree of operating leverage (DOL) measures sensitivity to changes in sales volume, while the degree of financial leverage (DFL) indicates the impact of changes in operating income on net income. The degree of total leverage (DTL) combines DOL and DFL.

Financial leverage can amplify both gains and losses in net income, affecting return on equity. The breakeven quantity of sales occurs when net income equals zero, while the operating breakeven quantity is where operating income equals zero.
