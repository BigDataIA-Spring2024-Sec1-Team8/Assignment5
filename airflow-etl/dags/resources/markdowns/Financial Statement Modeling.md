# Introduction

The member should be able to: compare top-down, bottom-up, and hybrid approaches for developing inputs to equity valuation models; compare “growth relative to GDP growth” and “market growth and market share” approaches to forecasting revenue; evaluate whether economies of scale are present in an industry by analyzing operating margins and sales levels; demonstrate methods to forecast cost of goods sold and operating expenses; demonstrate methods to forecast nonoperating items, financing costs, and income taxes; describe approaches to balance sheet modeling; demonstrate the development of a sales-based pro forma company model; explain how behavioral factors affect analyst forecasts and recommend remedial actions for analyst biases; explain how competitive factors affect prices and costs; evaluate the competitive position of a company based on a Porter’s five forces analysis; explain how to forecast industry and company sales and costs when they are subject to price inflation or deflation; evaluate the effects of technological developments on demand, selling prices, costs, and margins; explain considerations in the choice of an explicit forecast horizon; and explain an analyst’s choices in developing projections beyond the short-term forecast horizon.

## Summary

Analysts can use a top-down, bottom-up, or hybrid approach to forecasting income and expenses. Top-down approaches usually begin at the level of the overall economy. Bottom-up approaches begin at the level of the individual company or unit within the company (e.g., business segment). Time-series approaches are considered bottom-up, although time-series analysis can be a tool used in top-down approaches. Hybrid approaches include elements of top-down and bottom-up approaches., In a “growth relative to GDP growth” approach to forecasting revenue, the analyst forecasts the growth rate of nominal GDP and industry and company growth relative to GDP growth., In a “market growth and market share” approach to forecasting revenue, the analyst combines forecasts of growth in particular markets with forecasts of a company’s market share in the individual markets., Operating margins that are positively correlated with sales provide evidence of economies of scale in an industry., Some balance sheet line items, such as retained earnings, flow directly from the income statement, whereas accounts receivable, accounts payable, and inventory are closely linked to income statement projections., A common way to model working capital accounts is to use efficiency ratios., Return on invested capital (ROIC), defined as net operating profit less adjusted taxes divided by the difference between operating assets and operating liabilities, is an after-tax measure of profitability. High and persistent levels of ROIC are often associated with having a competitive advantage., Competitive factors affect a company’s ability to negotiate lower input prices with suppliers and to raise prices for products and services. Porter’s five forces framework can be used as a basis for identifying such factors., Inflation (deflation) affects pricing strategy depending on industry structure, competitive forces, and the nature of consumer demand., When a technological development results in a new product that threatens to cannibalize demand for an existing product, a unit forecast for the new product combined with an expected cannibalization factor can be used to estimate the impact on future demand for the existing product., Factors influencing the choice of the explicit forecast horizon include the projected holding period, an investor’s average portfolio turnover, the cyclicality of an industry, company-specific factors, and employer preferences., Key behavioral biases that influence analyst forecasts are overconfidence, illusion of control conservatism, representativeness, and confirmation bias.

## Technical Note

**Technical Note: Equity Valuation Model Inputs**

**Forecasting Approaches**

* **Top-down:** Starts with macroeconomic variables and flows down to company-specific inputs.
* **Bottom-up:** Focuses on individual company data and aggregates to industry level.
* **Hybrid:** Combines elements of both approaches.

**Revenue Forecasting**

* **Growth relative to GDP growth:** Projects growth relative to macroeconomic indicators.
* **Market growth and market share:** Forecasts market size and the company's expected market share.

**Cost Analysis**

* Economies of scale: Operating margins that increase with sales indicate scale advantages.
* Cost forecasting: Use historical data and industry benchmarks to estimate future costs.

**Non-Operating Items, Financing Costs, and Taxes**

* Forecast these items based on historical patterns, industry norms, and company-specific factors.

**Balance Sheet Modeling**

* Retained earnings flow directly from the income statement.
* Accounts receivable, payable, and inventory are linked to revenue and expense projections.
* Use efficiency ratios to model working capital accounts.
* Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures profitability.

**Competitive Analysis**

* Porter's five forces framework identifies factors affecting company competitiveness.
* Competitive factors influence prices, costs, and profits.

**Inflation and Deflation**

* Consider industry structure, competition, and consumer demand when adjusting for inflation/deflation.

**Forecast Horizon**

* Factors include: holding period, portfolio turnover, industry cyclicality, and employer preferences.

**Analyst Biases**

* Overconfidence, illusion of control, and confirmation bias can affect forecasts.
* Remedial actions include: transparency, data triangulation, and peer review.

**Technological Developments**

* Consider the impact of new technologies on demand, prices, costs, and margins.
