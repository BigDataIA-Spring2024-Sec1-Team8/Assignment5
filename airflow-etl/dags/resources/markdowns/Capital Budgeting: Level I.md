## Summary

Capital budgeting supports the most critical investments for many corporations—their investments in long-term assets. The principles of capital budgeting have been applied to other corporate investing and financing decisions and to security analysis and portfolio management., The typical steps in the capital budgeting process are: 1) generating ideas, 2) analyzing individual proposals, 3) planning the capital budget, and 4) monitoring and post-auditing., Types of projects appropriate for the capital budgeting process can be categorized as: 1) replacement, 2) expansion, 3) new products and services, and 4) regulatory, safety and environmental., Capital budgeting decisions are based on incremental after-tax cash flows discounted at the opportunity cost of funds. Financing costs are ignored because both the cost of debt and the cost of other capital are captured in the discount rate., The net present value (NPV) is the present value of all after-tax cash flows, or NPV=∑t=0nCFt(1+r)t where the investment outlays are negative cash flows included in the CFts and where r is the required rate of return for the investment., The IRR is the discount rate that makes the present value of all future cash flows sum to zero. This equation can be solved for the IRR: ∑t=0nCFt(1+IRR)t=0, The payback period is the number of years required to recover the original investment in a project. The payback is based on cash flows., The discounted payback period is the number of years it takes for the cumulative discounted cash flows from a project to equal the original investment., The average accounting rate of return (AAR) can be defined as follows: AAR=Average net incomeAverage book value, The profitability index (PI) is the present value of a project’s future cash flows divided by the initial investment: PI=PV of future cash flowsInitial investment=1+NPVInitial investment, The capital budgeting decision rules are to invest if the NPV > 0, if the IRR > r, or if the PI > 1.0 There are no decision rules for the payback period, discounted payback period, and AAR because they are not always sound measures., The NPV profile is a graph that shows a project’s NPV graphed as a function of various discount rates., For mutually exclusive projects that are ranked differently by the NPV and IRR, it is economically sound to choose the project with the higher NPV., The “multiple IRR problem” and the “no IRR problem” can arise for a project with nonconventional cash flows—cash flows that change signs more than once during the project’s life., The fact that projects with positive NPVs theoretically increase the value of the company and the value of its stock could explain the popularity of NPV as an evaluation method.

## Technical Note

**Capital Budgeting Process Summary**

Capital budgeting involves evaluating long-term investments for optimal allocation of funds. The process includes identifying potential projects, analyzing their viability, planning the budget, and post-implementation monitoring.

**Types of Capital Projects**

Capital projects can fall into categories such as replacement, expansion, new products/services, and regulatory/environmental compliance.

**Basic Principles**

Capital budgeting decisions are based on incremental after-tax cash flows discounted at the opportunity cost of funds, ignoring financing costs.

**Evaluation Methods**

Net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR), payback period, discounted payback period, and profitability index (PI) are common capital budgeting evaluation methods. The decision rule favors projects with positive NPV or IRR greater than the cost of capital.

**Mutually Exclusive Projects and Project Sequencing**

For mutually exclusive projects, choosing the one with the highest NPV is recommended. Project sequencing and capital rationing can impact project selection and evaluation.

**NPV vs. IRR**

NPV prioritizes the magnitude of cash flows, while IRR considers time-weighted returns. IRR can lead to multiple solutions or no solutions for non-conventional cash flows.

**Relation to Company Value**

Investments with positive NPVs tend to increase company value and share price.

**Problems with Evaluation Methods**

The payback period and discounted payback period may not accurately reflect profitability. The IRR can have multiple solutions or no solution for certain cash flows.

**Additional Notes:**

* The capital budgeting process supports important long-term investment decisions for many organizations.
* Various capital budgeting evaluation methods exist, each with its own advantages and limitations.
* The NPV method is generally considered more reliable than the IRR method for project evaluation.
