**Key Points**

* Testing is a systematic and planned process of examining a product or service to assess its quality, performance, or suitability for a given purpose.
* It involves evaluating both the functional and non-functional aspects of the product or service.
* Testing can be conducted at various stages of development, from requirements gathering to post-release support.
* Types of testing include unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing, and performance testing.
* Testing techniques include black box testing, white box testing, and gray box testing.
* Test cases are designed to identify and verify specific defects or requirements.
* Test coverage metrics quantify the extent to which the testing process has evaluated the product or service.
* Test automation tools can improve efficiency and reduce human error.
* Regression testing ensures that previously fixed defects do not re-emerge.
* Test reports summarize the testing results and provide recommendations for improvement.
