## Summary

In professional FX markets, currencies are identified by standard three-letter codes, and quoted in terms of a price and a base currency (P/B)., The spot exchange rate is typically for T + 2 delivery, and forward rates are for delivery for later periods. Both spot and forward rates are quoted in terms of a bid–offer price. Forward rates are quoted in terms of the spot rate plus forward points., An FX swap is a simultaneous spot and forward transaction; one leg of the swap is buying the base currency and the other is selling it. FX swaps are used to renew outstanding forward contracts once they mature, to “roll them forward.”, The domestic-currency return on foreign-currency assets can be broken into the foreign-currency asset return and the return on the foreign currency (the percentage appreciation or depreciation of the foreign currency against the domestic currency). These two components of the domestic-currency return are multiplicative., When there are several foreign-currency assets, the portfolio domestic-currency return is the weighted average of the individual domestic-currency returns (i.e., using the portfolio weights, which should sum to one), The risk of domestic-currency returns (its standard deviation) can be approximated by using a variance formula that recognizes the individual variances and covariances (correlations) among the foreign-currency asset returns and exchange rate movements., The calculation of the domestic-currency risk involves a large number of variables that must be estimated: the risks and correlations between all of the foreign-currency asset returns and their exchange rate risks., Guidance on where to target the portfolio along the risk spectrum is part of the IPS, which makes this a strategic decision based on the investment goals and constraints of the beneficial owners of the portfolio., If the IPS allows currency risk in the portfolio, the amount of desired currency exposure will depend on both portfolio diversification considerations and cost considerations. Views on the diversifying effects of foreign-currency exposures depend on the time horizon involved, the type of foreign-currency asset, and market conditions. Cost considerations also affect the hedging decision. Hedging is not free: It has both direct transactional costs as well as opportunity costs (the potential for favorable outcomes is foregone). Cost considerations make a perfect hedge difficult to maintain., Views on the diversifying effects of foreign-currency exposures depend on the time horizon involved, the type of foreign-currency asset, and market conditions., Cost considerations also affect the hedging decision. Hedging is not free: It has both direct transactional costs as well as opportunity costs (the potential for favorable outcomes is foregone). Cost considerations make a perfect hedge difficult to maintain., Currency management strategies can be located along a spectrum stretching from: passive, rules-based, complete hedging of currency exposures; discretionary hedging, which allows the portfolio manager some latitude on managing currency exposures; active currency management, which seeks out currency risk in order to manage it for profit; and to currency overlay programs that aggressively manage currency “alpha.”, passive, rules-based, complete hedging of currency exposures;, discretionary hedging, which allows the portfolio manager some latitude on managing currency exposures;, active currency management, which seeks out currency risk in order to manage it for profit; and to, currency overlay programs that aggressively manage currency “alpha.”, There are a variety of methods for forming market views. The use of macroeconomic fundamentals to predict future currency movements is based on estimating the “fair value” for a currency with the expectation that spot rates will eventually converge on this equilibrium value. Technical market indicators assume that, based on market psychology, historical price patterns in the data have a tendency to repeat. Technical indicators can be used to predict support and resistance levels in the market, as well as to confirm market trends and turning points. The carry trade is based on violations of uncovered interest rate parity, and is also based on selling low-yield currencies in order to invest in high-yield currencies. This approach is equivalent to trading the forward rate bias, which means selling currencies trading at a forward premium and buying currencies trading at a forward discount. Volatility trading uses the option market to express views on the distribution of future exchange rates, not their levels., The use of macroeconomic fundamentals to predict future currency movements is based on estimating the “fair value” for a currency with the expectation that spot rates will eventually converge on this equilibrium value., Technical market indicators assume that, based on market psychology, historical price patterns in the data have a tendency to repeat.

However, currency futures contracts are an option for smaller trading sizes and are frequently used in private wealth management., Forward contracts have the possibility of negative roll yield (the forward points embedded in the forward price can work for or against the hedge). The portfolio manager will have to balance the advantages and costs of hedging with forward contracts., Foreign-currency options can reduce opportunity costs (they allow the upside potential for favorable foreign-currency movements). However, the upfront option premiums must be paid., There are a variety of means to reduce the cost of the hedging with either forward or option contracts, but these cost-reduction measures always involve some combination of less downside protection and/or less upside potential., Hedging multiple foreign currencies uses the same tools and strategies used in hedging a single foreign-currency exposure; except now the correlation between residual currency exposures in the portfolio should be considered., Cross hedges introduce basis risk into the portfolio, which is the risk that the correlation between exposure and its cross hedging instrument may change in unexpected ways. Forward contracts typically have very little basis risk compared with movements in the underlying spot rate., The number of trading strategies that can be used, for hedging or speculative purposes, either for a single foreign currency or multiple foreign currencies, is near infinite. The manager must assess the costs, benefits, and risks of each in the context of the investment goals and constraints of the portfolio. There is no single “correct” approach.

## Technical Note

**Summary:**

1. Currency movements impact portfolio risk and return, necessitating appropriate management strategies.
2. Currency management involves choosing between passive hedging, discretionary hedging, active management, and overlay programs.
3. Different active trading strategies utilize macroeconomic fundamentals, technical analysis, carry-trade, and volatility trading.
4. Forward contracts and FX swaps are used to adjust hedge ratios, while cross-hedging, macro-hedging, and minimum-variance hedges are employed for portfolios with multiple currencies.
5. Emerging market currency exposures pose unique challenges and require careful management.
6. Forward contracts are typically preferred over futures contracts for hedging, while options can reduce opportunity costs.
7. Cost-reducing hedging strategies involve trade-offs between downside protection and upside potential.
8. Correlation between currency exposures affects hedging decisions in multi-currency portfolios.
9. There is no single "correct" currency management approach, as the optimal strategy depends on portfolio goals and market conditions.
10. The member should be able to analyze currency effects, make strategic choices, and implement appropriate management programs based on market conditions and portfolio objectives.
