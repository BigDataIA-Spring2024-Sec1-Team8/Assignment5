## Technical Note: Cost of Capital

**Executive Summary**

The cost of capital is a critical factor in financial decision-making. This note summarizes the key factors that impact the cost of capital and methods used to estimate it.

**Top-Down and Bottom-Up Factors**

**Top-Down Factors:**
- Economic growth
- Interest rates
- Inflation
- Market risk premium

**Bottom-Up Factors:**
- Company-specific risk
- Financial leverage
- Dividend policy

**Estimating the Cost of Debt**

- Risk-free rate (e.g., U.S. Treasury bond yield)
- Credit spread (based on credit rating)
- Yield to maturity (considers time to maturity)

**Estimating the Equity Risk Premium**

**Historical Approach:**
- Average return on the stock market over a long period (e.g., 10 years)

**Forward-Looking Approach:**
- Earnings yield (using current earnings and stock price)
- Dividend discount model (using current dividends and expected growth rate)

**Estimating the Required Return on Equity**

- **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM):** Risk-free rate + (Beta * Equity risk premium)
- **Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC):** Average of cost of debt and cost of equity, weighted by their respective percentages in the capital structure

**Valuing a Company's Capital Structure**

- Compare cost of capital to peers
- Analyze financial leverage (debt-to-equity ratio)
- Evaluate potential impact of changes in capital structure on cost of capital
