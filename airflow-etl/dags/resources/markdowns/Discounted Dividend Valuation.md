## Summary

In DCF models, the value of any asset is the present value of its (expected) future cash flows V 0 = ∑ t = 1 n CF t ( 1 + r ) t , where V 0 is the value of the asset as of t = 0 (today), CF t is the (expected) cash flow at time t, and r is the discount rate or required rate of return. For infinitely lived assets such as common stocks, n runs to infinity., Several alternative streams of expected cash flows can be used to value equities, including dividends, free cash flow, and residual income. A discounted dividend approach is most suitable for dividend-paying stocks in which the company has a discernible dividend policy that has an understandable relationship to the company’s profitability and the investor has a non-control (minority ownership) perspective., The free cash flow approach (FCFF or FCFE) might be appropriate when the company does not pay dividends, dividends differ substantially from FCFE, free cash flows align with profitability, or the investor takes a control (majority ownership) perspective., The residual income approach can be useful when the company does not pay dividends (as an alternative to a FCF approach) or free cash flow is negative., The DDM with a single holding period gives stock value as V 0 = D 1 ( 1 + r ) 1 + P 1 ( 1 + r ) 1 = D 1 + P 1 ( 1 + r ) 1 , where D 1 is the expected dividend at Time 1 and V 0 is the stock’s (expected) value at Time 0. Assuming that V 0 is equal to today’s market price, P 0, the expected holding-period return is r = D 1 + P 1 P 0 − 1 = D 1 P 0 + P 1 − P 0 P 0 ., The expression for the DDM for any given finite holding period n and the general expression for the DDM are, respectively, V 0 = ∑ t = 1 n D t ( 1 + r ) t + P n ( 1 + r ) n and V 0 = ∑ t = 1 ∞ D t ( 1 + r ) t ., There are two main approaches to the problem of forecasting dividends. First, an analyst can assign the entire stream of expected future dividends to one of several stylized growth patterns. Second, an analyst can forecast a finite number of dividends individually up to a terminal point and value the remaining dividends either by assigning them to a stylized growth pattern or by forecasting share price as of the terminal point of the dividend forecasts., The Gordon growth model assumes that dividends grow at a constant rate g forever, so that Dt = Dt– 1(1 + g). The dividend stream in the Gordon growth model has a value of V 0 = D 0 ( 1 + g ) r − g , or V 0 = D 1 r − g where r > g ., The value of non-callable fixed-rate perpetual preferred stock is V 0 = D/r, where D is the stock’s (constant) annual dividend., Assuming that price equals value, the Gordon growth model estimate of a stock’s expected rate of return is r = D 0 ( 1 + g ) P 0 + g = D 1 P 0 + g ., Given an estimate of the next-period dividend and the stock’s required rate of return, the Gordon growth model can be used to estimate the dividend growth rate implied by the current market price (making a constant growth rate assumption)., The present value of growth opportunities is the part of a stock’s total value, V 0, that comes from profitable future growth opportunities in contrast to the value associated with assets already in place. The relationship is V 0 = E 1/r + PVGO, where E 1/r is defined as the no-growth value per share., The leading price-to-earnings ratio (P 0/E 1) and the trailing price-to-earnings ratio (P 0/E 0) can be expressed in terms of the Gordon growth model as, respectively, P 0 E 1 = D 1 / E 1 r − g = 1 − b r − g and P 0 E 0 = D 0 ( 1 + g ) / E 0 r − g = ( 1 − b ) ( 1 + g ) r − g . The foregoing expressions give a stock’s justified price-to-earnings ratio based on forecasts of fundamentals (given that the Gordon growth model is appropriate)., The Gordon growth model may be useful for valuing broad-based equity indexes and the stock of businesses with earnings that are expected to grow at a stable rate comparable to or lower than the economy’s nominal growth rate., Gordon growth model values are very sensitive to the assumed growth rate and required rate of return., For many companies, growth falls into phases. In the growth phase, a company enjoys an abnormally high growth rate in earnings per share, called supernormal growth. In the transition phase, earnings growth slows. In the mature phase, the company reaches an equilibrium in which such factors as earnings growth and the return on equity stabilize at levels that can be sustained long term. Analysts often apply multistage DCF models to value the stock of a company with multistage growth prospects., The two-stage dividend discount model assumes different growth rates in Stage 1 and Stage 2: V 0 = ∑ t = 1 n D 0 ( 1 + g S ) t ( 1 + r ) t + D 0 ( 1 + g S ) n ( 1 + g L ) ( 1 + r ) n ( r − g L ) , where gS is the expected dividend growth rate in the first period and gL is the expected growth rate in the second period., The terminal stock value, Vn , is sometimes found with the Gordon growth model or with some other method, such as applying a P/E multiplier to forecasted EPS as of the terminal date., The H-model assumes that the dividend growth rate declines linearly from a high supernormal rate to the normal growth rate during Stage 1 and then grows at a constant normal growth rate thereafter: V 0 = D 0 ( 1 + g L ) r − g L + D 0 H ( g S − g L ) r − g L = D 0 ( 1 + g L ) + D 0 H ( g S − g L ) r − g L ., There are two basic three-stage models. In one version, the growth rate in the middle stage is constant. In the second version, the growth rate declines linearly in Stage 2 and becomes constant and normal in Stage 3., In addition to valuing equities, the IRR of a DDM, assuming assets are correctly priced in the marketplace, has been used to estimate required returns. For simpler models (such as the one-period model, the Gordon growth model, and the H-model), well-known formulas may be used to calculate these rates of return. For many dividend streams, however, the rate of return must be found by trial and error, producing a discount rate that equates the present value of the forecasted dividend stream to the current market price., Multistage DDM models can accommodate a wide variety of patterns of expected dividends. Even though such models may use stylized assumptions about growth, they can provide useful approximations., Dividend growth rates can be obtained from analyst forecasts, statistical forecasting models, or company fundamentals. The sustainable growth rate depends on the ROE and the earnings retention rate, b: g = b × ROE. This expression can be expanded further, using the DuPont formula, as g = Net income − Dividends Net income × Net income Sales × Sales Total assets × Total assets Shareholders' equity .

## Technical Note

**Inputs to DCF Models:**

* Dividends: Suitable for dividend-paying stocks with a discernible dividend policy and a minority ownership perspective.
* Free Cash Flow: Appropriate when dividends differ from FCF, FCF aligns with profitability, or a control ownership perspective is taken.
* Residual Income: Useful when companies do not pay dividends or when FCF is negative.

**Dividend Discount Models (DDMs):**

* Calculate the present value of expected dividends to determine the value of a common stock.
* Gordon Growth Model: Assumes a constant dividend growth rate and has formulas for calculating the value of common stock and implied growth rate.
* Multistage DDMs: Accommodate varying dividend growth patterns, such as those in the growth, transition, and maturity phases of a business.

**Other Concepts:**

* Terminal Value: A method for forecasting the stock price at the end of a dividend forecast period.
* Sustainable Growth Rate: Represents the maximum rate at which a company can grow while maintaining a constant payout ratio and return on equity.
* Present Value of Growth Opportunities (PVGO): The portion of a stock's value attributable to future growth opportunities.
* Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio: Can be expressed in terms of the Gordon Growth Model to determine justified P/E ratios.

**Strengths and Limitations of Gordon Growth Model:**

* Strengths: Simple to apply, assumes constant growth, can estimate required returns.
* Limitations: Assumes constant growth, sensitive to growth rate and required return assumptions.
