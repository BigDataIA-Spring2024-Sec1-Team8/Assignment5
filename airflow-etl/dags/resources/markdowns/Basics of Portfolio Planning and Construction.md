## Summary

The IPS is the starting point of the portfolio management process. Without a full understanding of the client’s situation and requirements, it is unlikely that successful results will be achieved., The IPS can take a variety of forms. A typical format will include the client’s investment objectives and also list the constraints that apply to the client’s portfolio., The client’s objectives are specified in terms of risk tolerance and return requirements., The constraints section covers factors that need to be considered when constructing a portfolio for the client that meets the objectives. The typical constraint categories are liquidity requirements, time horizon, regulatory requirements, tax status, and unique needs., Clients may have personal objections to certain products or practices, which could lead to the exclusion of certain companies, countries, or types of securities from the investable universe as well as the client’s benchmark. Such considerations are often referred to as ESG (environmental, social, governance)., ESG considerations can be integrated into an investment policy by exclusionary screening, best-in-class selection, active ownership, thematic and impact investing and ESG integration in security analysis., Risk objectives are specifications for portfolio risk that reflect the risk tolerance of the client. Quantitative risk objectives can be absolute or relative or a combination of the two., The client’s overall risk tolerance is a function of the client’s ability to accept risk and their “risk attitude,” which can be considered the client’s willingness to take risk., The client’s return objectives can be stated on an absolute or a relative basis. As an example of an absolute objective, the client may want to achieve a particular percentage rate of return. Alternatively, the return objective can be stated on a relative basis, for example, relative to a benchmark return., The liquidity section of the IPS should state what the client’s requirements are to draw cash from the portfolio., The time horizon section of the IPS should state the time horizon over which the investor is investing. This horizon may be the period during which the portfolio is accumulating before any assets need to be withdrawn., Tax status varies among investors and a client’s tax status should be stated in the IPS., The IPS should state any legal or regulatory restrictions that constrain the investment of the portfolio., The unique circumstances section of the IPS should cover any other aspect of a client’s circumstances that is likely to have a material impact on the composition of the portfolio. Certain ESG implementation approaches, such as negative (exclusionary) screening, best-in-class, thematic investing, impact investing, and ESG integration may be discussed in this section., Asset classes are the building blocks of an asset allocation. An asset class is a category of assets that have similar characteristics, attributes, and risk/return relationships. Traditionally, investors have distinguished cash, equities, bonds, and real estate as the major asset classes., A strategic asset allocation results from combining the constraints and objectives articulated in the IPS and capital market expectations regarding the asset classes., As time goes on, a client’s asset allocation will drift from the target allocation, and the amount of allowable drift as well as a rebalancing policy should be formalized., In addition to taking systematic risk, an investment committee may choose to take tactical asset allocation risk or security selection risk. The amount of return attributable to these decisions can be measured., ESG considerations may be integrated into the portfolio planning and construction process. Such considerations can be difficult given that ESG data is often not required to be disclosed by companies. ESG implementation approaches require a set of instructions for investment managers with regards to the selection of securities, the exercise of shareholder rights and the selection of investment strategies.

## Technical Note

**Summary:**

An Investment Policy Statement (IPS) is crucial for guiding investment decisions, aligning with client needs, and mitigating risks. The IPS establishes risk and return objectives based on the client's risk tolerance and return requirements. Constraints such as liquidity, time horizon, tax concerns, and ESG considerations influence asset allocation. Asset classes provide the building blocks for strategic asset allocation, which aims to match investments with client objectives. The IPS may include provisions for tactical asset allocation risk or security selection risk. ESG implementation approaches, such as exclusionary screening or thematic investing, integrate ESG factors into portfolio planning. Ongoing monitoring and review ensure alignment with the IPS and address any necessary adjustments.
