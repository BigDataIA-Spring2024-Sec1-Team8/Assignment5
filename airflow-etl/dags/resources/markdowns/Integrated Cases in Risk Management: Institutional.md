## Technical Note

**Summary:**

Institutional investors face a range of financial risks, including market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, and operational risk. They also encounter environmental and social risks, such as climate change, labor exploitation, and supply chain disruptions. To effectively manage these risks, institutional investors need to analyze their portfolio's exposures, evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of their enterprise risk management (ERM) systems, and explore appropriate risk management techniques. Long-term direct investments pose unique risks that require specialized management approaches. The effectiveness of ERM systems can be enhanced by considering various factors, such as risk identification, assessment, monitoring, and reporting. Institutional investors play a crucial role in addressing sustainability challenges and fostering positive societal outcomes.
