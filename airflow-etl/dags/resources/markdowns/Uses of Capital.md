# Introduction

The member should be able to: describe the capital allocation process and basic principles of capital allocation; demonstrate the use of net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return (IRR) in allocating capital and describe the advantages and disadvantages of each method; describe expected relations among a company’s investments, company value, and share price; describe types of real options relevant to capital investment; describe common capital allocation pitfalls.

## Summary

Capital allocation supports the most critical investments for many corporations—their investments in long-term assets. The principles of capital allocation have been applied to other corporate investing and financing decisions and to security analysis and portfolio management., The typical steps in the capital allocation process are (1) generating ideas, (2) analyzing investment opportunities, (3) planning the capital allocation, and (4) monitoring and post-auditing., Types of investments appropriate for the capital allocation process can be categorized as (1) replacement, (2) expansion, (3) new products and services, and (4) regulatory, safety, and environmental., Capital allocation decisions are based on incremental after-tax cash flows discounted at the opportunity cost of funds. Financing costs are ignored because both the cost of debt and the cost of other capital are captured in the discount rate., The net present value is the present value of all after-tax cash flows, where the investment outlays are negative cash flows included in the s and where r is the required rate of return for the investment., The IRR is the discount rate that makes the present value of all future cash flows sum to zero.

## Technical Note

**Capital Allocation Process**

- Involves generating investment ideas, analyzing opportunities, planning capital allocation, and monitoring/post-auditing.

**Types of Investments**

- Replacement: Replacing existing assets
- Expansion: Increasing capacity or acquiring new assets
- New products/services: Developing or acquiring new offerings
- Regulatory/safety/environmental: Complying with regulations or improving operational efficiency

**Capital Allocation Metrics**

- **Net Present Value (NPV)**: Present value of future cash flows minus initial investment
- **Internal Rate of Return (IRR)**: Discount rate that equates NPV to zero

**Advantages and Disadvantages of NPV and IRR**

| **Metric** | **Advantages** | **Disadvantages** |
|---|---|---|
| **NPV** | Considers time value of money, handles uneven cash flows well | Sensitive to discount rate, can give negative NPV for positive IRR |
| **IRR** | Easy to interpret, indicates maximum acceptable cost of capital | Does not consider time value of money, can give multiple IRRs |

**Relation of Investments to Company Value and Share Price**

- Positive NPV investments enhance company value and share price.
- Negative NPV investments detract from company value and share price.

**Real Options**

- Investments with embedded options to delay, expand, or abandon the project.

**Common Capital Allocation Pitfalls**

- Ignoring incremental cash flows
- Using biased or inaccurate projections
- Failing to consider real options
- Focusing solely on short-term gains
