## Summary

Performance measurement provides an overall indication of the portfolio’s performance., Performance attribution builds on performance measurement to explain how the performance was achieved., Performance appraisal leverages both returns and attribution to infer the quality of the investment process., An effective attribution process must reconcile to the total portfolio return/risk, reflect the investment decision-making process, quantify the active portfolio management decisions, and provide a complete understanding of the excess return/risk of the portfolio., Return attribution analyzes the impact of investment decisions on the returns, whereas risk attribution analyzes the risk consequences of the investment decisions., Macro attribution considers the decisions of the fund sponsor, whereas micro attribution considers the decisions of the individual portfolio manager., Returns-based attribution uses returns to identify the factors that have generated those returns., Holdings-based attribution uses the holdings over time to evaluate the decisions that contributed to the returns., Transactions-based attribution uses both holdings and transactions to fully explain the performance over the evaluation period., There are various techniques for interpreting the sources of portfolio returns using a specified attribution approach., Fixed-income attribution considers the unique factors that drive bond returns, including interest rate risk and default risk., When selecting a risk attribution approach, practitioners should consider the investment decision-making process and the type of attribution analysis., Attribution is used to calculate and interpret the contribution to portfolio return and volatility from the asset allocation and within-asset-class active/passive decisions., Liability-based benchmarks focus on the cash flows that the assets are required to generate., Asset-based benchmarks contain a collection of assets to compare against the portfolio’s assets., Valid benchmarks should be unambiguous, investable, measurable, appropriate, reflective of current investment opinions, specified in advance, and accountable., Benchmark misspecification creates subsequent incorrect performance measurement and invalidates the attribution and appraisal analyses., Alternative investments are difficult to benchmark because they are typically less liquid, have fewer available market benchmarks, and often lack transparency., Investment performance appraisal ratios—including the Sortino ratio, upside/downside capture ratios, maximum drawdown, and drawdown duration—measure investment skill., Appraisal ratios must be used with care, noting the assumptions of each ratio and affording the appropriateness to the measured investment process, risk tolerance, and investor time horizon., Although appraisal ratios help identify manager skill (as opposed to luck), they often are based on investment return data, which are often limited and subject to error., Evaluation of investment manager skill requires the use of a broad range of analysis tools, with fundamental understanding of how the tools work, how they complement each other, and their specific limitations.

## Technical Note

**Summary:**

Portfolio evaluation consists of performance measurement, attribution, and appraisal. Performance measurement evaluates overall portfolio performance. Performance attribution explains how performance was achieved, while performance appraisal assesses the quality of investment decisions. An effective attribution process should reconcile to total portfolio return/risk, reflect investment decision-making, quantify active decisions, and provide a comprehensive understanding of excess return/risk. Return attribution analyzes the impact of investment decisions on returns, while risk attribution analyzes their risk consequences. Liability-based benchmarks focus on cash flow generation, while asset-based benchmarks provide a peer group comparison. Performance appraisal ratios measure investment skill but have limitations. Evaluating investment manager skill requires a comprehensive approach, considering the interrelationships and limitations of these components.
