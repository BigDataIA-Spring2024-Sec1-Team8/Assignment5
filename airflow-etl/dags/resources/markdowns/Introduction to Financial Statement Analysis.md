## Summary

The primary purpose of financial reports is to provide information and data about a company’s financial position and performance, including profitability and cash flows. The information presented in the reports —including the financial statements and notes and management’s commentary or management’s discussion and analysis—allows the financial analyst to assess a company’s financial position and performance and trends in that performance., The primary financial statements are the statement of financial position (i.e., the balance sheet), the statement of comprehensive income (or two statements consisting of an income statement and a statement of comprehensive income), the statement of changes in equity, and the statement of cash flows., The balance sheet discloses what resources a company controls (assets) and what it owes (liabilities) at a specific point in time. Owners’ equity represents the net assets of the company; it is the owners’ residual interest in, or residual claim on, the company’s assets after deducting its liabilities. The relationship among the three parts of the balance sheet (assets, liabilities, and owners’ equity) may be shown in equation form as follows: Assets = Liabilities + Owners’ equity., The income statement presents information on the financial results of a company’s business activities over a period of time. The income statement communicates how much revenue and other income the company generated during a period and what expenses, including losses, it incurred in connection with generating that revenue and other income. The basic equation underlying the income statement is Revenue + Other income – Expenses = Net income., The statement of comprehensive income includes all items that change owners’ equity except transactions with owners. Some of these items are included as part of net income, and some are reported as other comprehensive income (OCI)., The statement of changes in equity provides information about increases or decreases in the various components of owners’ equity., Although the income statement and balance sheet provide measures of a company’s success, cash and cash flow are also vital to a company’s long-term success. Disclosing the sources and uses of cash helps creditors, investors, and other statement users evaluate the company’s liquidity, solvency, and financial flexibility., The notes (also referred to as footnotes) that accompany the financial statements are an integral part of those statements and provide information that is essential to understanding the statements. Analysts should evaluate note disclosures regarding the use of alternative accounting methods, estimates, and assumptions., In addition to the financial statements, a company provides other sources of information that are useful to the financial analyst. As part of his or her analysis, the financial analyst should read and assess this additional information, particularly that presented in the management commentary (also called management report[ing], operating and financial review, and management’s discussion and analysis [MD&A])., A publicly traded company must have an independent audit performed on its annual financial statements. The auditor’s report expresses an opinion on the financial statements and provides some assurance about whether the financial statements fairly present a company’s financial position, performance, and cash flows. In addition, for US publicly traded companies, auditors must also express an opinion on the company’s internal control systems., Information on the economy, industry, and peer companies is useful in putting the company’s financial performance and position in perspective and in assessing the company’s future. In most cases, information from sources apart from the company are crucial to an analyst’s effectiveness., The financial statement analysis framework provides steps that can be followed in any financial statement analysis project. These steps are: articulate the purpose and context of the analysis; collect input data; process data; analyze/interpret the processed data; develop and communicate conclusions and recommendations; and follow up., articulate the purpose and context of the analysis;, collect input data;, process data;, analyze/interpret the processed data;, develop and communicate conclusions and recommendations; and, follow up.

**Technical Note: Financial Reporting and Analysis**

Financial reporting provides crucial information about a company's financial performance and position. The primary financial statements include the statement of financial position (balance sheet), statement of comprehensive income (income statement), statement of changes in equity, and statement of cash flows.

The balance sheet shows a company's assets, liabilities, and equity at a specific point in time. The income statement presents its financial results over a period of time, including revenue, expenses, and net income. The statement of comprehensive income includes all items that change owners' equity, including net income and other comprehensive income. The statement of changes in equity discloses changes in the various components of owners' equity.

Financial statement notes and management's commentary provide additional information essential for analysis. Audits of financial statements provide assurance about their fairness and accuracy, and effective internal controls enhance financial reporting reliability.

Information sources beyond financial statements, such as industry data and peer company information, help analysts put a company's performance into context. The financial statement analysis framework provides a structured approach for conducting analysis, including articulating its purpose, collecting data, analyzing and interpreting findings, and communicating conclusions.
