## Summary

A fundamental principle of valuation is that the value of any financial asset is equal to the present value of its expected future cash flows., A fixed-income security is a portfolio of zero-coupon bonds., Each zero-coupon bond has its own discount rate that depends on the shape of the yield curve and when the cash flow is delivered in time., In well-functioning markets, prices adjust until there are no opportunities for arbitrage., The law of one price states that two goods that are perfect substitutes must sell for the same current price in the absence of transaction costs., An arbitrage opportunity is a transaction that involves no cash outlay yet results in a riskless profit., Using the arbitrage-free approach, viewing a security as a package of zero-coupon bonds means that two bonds with the same maturity and different coupon rates are viewed as different packages of zero-coupon bonds and valued accordingly., For bonds that are option free, an arbitrage-free value is simply the present value of expected future values using the benchmark spot rates., A binomial interest rate tree permits the short interest rate to take on one of two possible values consistent with the volatility assumption and an interest rate model., An interest rate tree is a visual representation of the possible values of interest rates (forward rates) based on an interest rate model and an assumption about interest rate volatility., The possible interest rates for any following period are consistent with the following three assumptions: (1) an interest rate model that governs the random process of interest rates, (2) the assumed level of interest rate volatility, and (3) the current benchmark yield curve., From the lognormal distribution, adjacent interest rates on the tree are multiples of e raised to the 2σ power., One of the benefits of a lognormal distribution is that if interest rates get too close to zero, then the absolute change in interest rates becomes smaller and smaller., We use the backward induction valuation methodology that involves starting at maturity, filling in those values, and working back from right to left to find the bond’s value at the desired node., The interest rate tree is fit to the current yield curve by choosing interest rates that result in the benchmark bond value. By doing this, the bond value is arbitrage free., An option-free bond that is valued by using the binomial interest rate tree should have the same value as discounting by the spot rates., Pathwise valuation calculates the present value of a bond for each possible interest rate path and takes the average of these values across paths., The Monte Carlo method is an alternative method for simulating a sufficiently large number of potential interest rate paths in an effort to discover how the value of a security is affected and involves randomly selecting paths in an effort to approximate the results of a complete pathwise valuation.

## Technical Note

**Summary:**

Arbitrage-free valuation entails valuing a fixed-income instrument as a portfolio of zero-coupon bonds, equating its value to the present value of expected future cash flows. A binomial interest rate tree models interest rate evolution, enabling the calculation of bond values using backward induction valuation. To match the yield curve, the tree is calibrated, aligning spot rates with bond values. The binomial lattice approach aligns with zero-coupon yield curve pricing. Pathwise valuation and Monte Carlo simulations estimate bond values by considering all possible interest rate paths. These methods provide a framework for accurately valuing fixed-income instruments in various market conditions, ensuring risk-free profits and accurate pricing.
