# Introduction

The member should be able to: interpret interest rates as required rates of return, discount rates, or opportunity costs; explain an interest rate as the sum of a real risk-free rate and premiums that compensate investors for bearing distinct types of risk; calculate and interpret the effective annual rate, given the stated annual interest rate and the frequency of compounding; solve time value of money problems for different frequencies of compounding; calculate and interpret the future value (FV) and present value (PV) of a single sum of money, an ordinary annuity, an annuity due, a perpetuity (PV only), and a series of unequal cash flows; demonstrate the use of a time line in modeling and solving time value of money problems.

## Summary

The interest rate, r, is the required rate of return; r is also called the discount rate or opportunity cost., An interest rate can be viewed as the sum of the real risk-free interest rate and a set of premiums that compensate lenders for risk: an inflation premium, a default risk premium, a liquidity premium, and a maturity premium., The future value, FV, is the present value, PV, times the future value factor, (1 + r)N., The interest rate, r, makes current and future currency amounts equivalent based on their time value., The stated annual interest rate is a quoted interest rate that does not account for compounding within the year., The periodic rate is the quoted interest rate per period; it equals the stated annual interest rate divided by the number of compounding periods per year., The effective annual rate is the amount by which a unit of currency will grow in a year with interest on interest included., An annuity is a finite set of level sequential cash flows., There are two types of annuities, the annuity due and the ordinary annuity. The annuity due has a first cash flow that occurs immediately; the ordinary annuity has a first cash flow that occurs one period from the present (indexed at t = 1)., On a time line, we can index the present as 0 and then display equally spaced hash marks to represent a number of periods into the future. This representation allows us to index how many periods away each cash flow will be paid., Annuities may be handled in a similar approach as single payments if we use annuity factors rather than single-payment factors., The present value, PV, is the future value, FV, times the present value factor, (1 + r)âˆ’N., The present value of a perpetuity is A/r, where A is the periodic payment to be received forever., It is possible to calculate an unknown variable, given the other relevant variables in time value of money problems., The cash flow additivity principle can be used to solve problems with uneven cash flows by combining single payments and annuities.

## Technical Note

**Key Points:**

* **Interest Rates:** An interest rate represents a required rate of return, a discount rate, or an opportunity cost.
* **Structure of Interest Rates:** Interest rates comprise a real risk-free rate and premiums for inflation, default, liquidity, and maturity risks.
* **Effective Annual Rate:** The effective annual rate considers the effect of compounding and is higher than the stated annual rate.
* **Time Value of Money:** Time value of money involves valuing money at different points in time based on an interest rate.
* **Future and Present Values:** The future value represents the growth of an investment, while the present value represents the current worth of future cash flows.
* **Types of Cash Flows:** Cash flows can be single sums, annuities (ordinary or due), or perpetuities, where payments are received forever.
* **Timelines:** Timelines are graphical representations used to model and solve time value of money problems.
* **Annuity Factors:** Annuity factors facilitate the calculation of present and future values of annuities.
* **Unknown Variable Calculation:** Time value of money problems can solve for unknown variables using the appropriate formulas.
* **Cash Flow Additivity:** Uneven cash flows can be analyzed by combining single payments and annuities.
