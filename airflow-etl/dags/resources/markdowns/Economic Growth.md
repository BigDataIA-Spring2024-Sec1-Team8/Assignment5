## Summary

The sustainable rate of economic growth is measured by the rate of increase in the economy’s productive capacity or potential GDP., Growth in real GDP measures how rapidly the total economy is expanding. Per capita GDP, defined as real GDP divided by population, measures the standard of living in each country., The growth rate of real GDP and the level of per capita real GDP vary widely among countries. As a result, investment opportunities differ by country., Equity markets respond to anticipated growth in earnings. Higher sustainable economic growth should lead to higher earnings growth and equity market valuation ratios, all other things being equal., The best estimate for the long-term growth in earnings for a given country is the estimate of the growth rate in potential GDP., In the long run, the growth rate of earnings cannot exceed the growth in potential GDP. Labor productivity is critical because it affects the level of the upper limit. A permanent increase in productivity growth will raise the upper limit on earnings growth and should translate into faster long-run earnings growth and a corresponding increase in stock price appreciation., For global fixed-income investors, a critical macroeconomic variable is the rate of inflation. One of the best indicators of short- to intermediate-term inflation trends is the difference between the growth rate of actual and potential GDP., Capital deepening, an increase in the capital-to-labor ratio, occurs when the growth rate of capital (net investment) exceeds the growth rate of labor. In a graph of output per capita versus the capital-to-labor ratio, it is reflected by a move along the curve (i.e., the production function)., An increase in total factor productivity causes a proportional upward shift in the entire production function., One method of measuring sustainable growth uses the production function and the growth accounting framework developed by Solow. It arrives at the growth rate of potential GDP by estimating the growth rates of the economy’s capital and labor inputs plus an estimate of total factor productivity., An alternative method measures potential growth as the long-term growth rate of the labor force plus the long-term growth rate of labor productivity., The forces driving economic growth include the quantity and quality of labor and the supply of non-ICT and ICT capital, public capital, raw materials, and technological knowledge., The labor supply is determined by population growth, the labor force participation rate, and net immigration. The physical capital stock in a country increases with net investment. The correlation between long-run economic growth and the rate of investment is high., Technological advances are discoveries that make it possible to produce more or higher-quality goods and services with the same resources or inputs. Technology is a major factor determining TFP. TFP is the main factor affecting long-term, sustainable economic growth rates in developed countries and also includes the cumulative effects of scientific advances, applied research and development, improvements in management methods, and ways of organizing production that raise the productive capacity of factories and offices., Total factor productivity, estimated using a growth accounting equation, is the residual component of growth after accounting for the weighted contributions of all explicit factors (e.g., labor and capital)., Labor productivity is defined as output per worker or per hour worked. Growth in labor productivity depends on capital deepening and technological progress., The academic growth literature is divided into three theories —the classical view, the neoclassical model, and the new endogenous growth view., In the classical model, growth in per capita income is only temporary because an exploding population with limited resources brings per capita income growth to an end., In the neoclassical model, a sustained increase in investment increases the economy’s growth rate only in the short run. Capital is subject to diminishing marginal returns, so long-run growth depends solely on population growth, progress in TFP, and labor’s share of income., The neoclassical model assumes that the production function exhibits diminishing marginal productivity with respect to any individual input., The point at which capital per worker and output per worker are growing at equal, sustainable rates is called the steady state or balanced growth path for the economy. In the steady state, total output grows at the rate of labor force growth plus the rate of growth of TFP divided by the elasticity of output with respect to labor input., The following parameters affect the steady-state values for the capital-to-labor ratio and output per worker: saving rate, labor force growth, growth in TFP, depreciation rate, and elasticity of output with respect to capital., The main criticism of the neoclassical model is that it provides no quantifiable prediction of the rate or form of TFP change. TFP progress is regarded as exogenous to the model., Endogenous growth theory explains technological progress within the model rather than treating it as exogenous. As a result, self-sustaining growth emerges as a natural consequence of the model and the economy does not converge to a steady-state rate of growth that is independent of saving/investment decisions., Unlike the neoclassical model, where increasing capital will result in diminishing marginal returns, the endogenous growth model allows for the possibility of constant or even increasing returns to capital in the aggregate economy., In the endogenous growth model, expenditures made on R&D and for human capital may have large positive externalities or spillover effects. Private spending by companies on knowledge capital generates benefits to the economy as a whole that exceed the private benefit to the company., The convergence hypothesis predicts that the rates of growth of productivity and GDP should be higher in the developing countries. Those higher growth rates imply that the per capita GDP gap between developing and developed economies should narrow over time. The evidence on convergence is mixed., Countries fail to converge because of low rates of investment and savings, lack of property rights, political instability, poor education and health, restrictions on trade, and tax and regulatory policies that discourage work and investing., Opening an economy to financial and trade flows has a major impact on economic growth. The evidence suggests that more open and trade-oriented economies will grow at a faster rate.

## Technical Note

**Key Points**

- Economic growth is measured by the increase in potential GDP, which reflects the economy's productive capacity.
- Potential GDP growth is driven by capital deepening (increased capital-to-labor ratio) and technological progress (increase in total factor productivity).
- Equity markets respond to anticipated growth in earnings, which is limited by potential GDP growth.
- Capital deepening and technological progress increase labor productivity, which affects earnings growth and stock appreciation.
- Growth accounting relations can be used to forecast potential GDP based on input growth rates and total factor productivity.
- Natural resources and demographics affect economic growth, but limitations and convergence hypotheses suggest varying outcomes.
- Investment in physical, human, and technological capital stimulates growth.
- Classical, neoclassical, and endogenous growth theories explain growth mechanisms and predict steady-state outcomes.
- Governments incentivize private investment in technology to promote long-term growth.
- Removing trade barriers enhances investment, profits, employment, and growth in participating economies.
