## Summary

Security market indexes are intended to measure the values of different target markets (security markets, market segments, or asset classes)., The constituent securities selected for inclusion in the security market index are intended to represent the target market., A price return index reflects only the prices of the constituent securities., A total return index reflects not only the prices of the constituent securities but also the reinvestment of all income received since the inception of the index., Methods used to weight the constituents of an index range from the very simple, such as price and equal weightings, to the more complex, such as market-capitalization and fundamental weightings., Choices in index construction—in particular, the choice of weighting method—affect index valuation and returns., Index management includes 1) periodic rebalancing to ensure that the index maintains appropriate weightings and 2) reconstitution to ensure the index represents the desired target market., Rebalancing and reconstitution create turnover in an index. Reconstitution can dramatically affect prices of current and prospective constituents., Indexes serve a variety of purposes. They gauge market sentiment and serve as benchmarks for actively managed portfolios. They act as proxies for measuring systematic risk and risk-adjusted performance. They also serve as proxies for asset classes in asset allocation models and as model portfolios for investment products., Investors can choose from security market indexes representing various asset classes, including equity, fixed-income, commodity, real estate, and hedge fund indexes., Within most asset classes, index providers offer a wide variety of indexes, ranging from broad market indexes to highly specialized indexes based on the issuer’s geographic region, economic development group, or economic sector or other factors., Proper use of security market indexes depends on understanding their construction and management.

## Technical Note

**Summary:**

Security market indexes measure the values of target markets, represented by constituent securities. Price return indexes reflect constituent prices, while total return indexes include reinvested income. Weighting methods, ranging from price to market-capitalization, affect index valuation and returns. Index management involves rebalancing and reconstitution, which create turnover and price impacts. Indexes serve various purposes, including gauging market sentiment, benchmarking, measuring risk, and asset allocation. Investors can choose from equity, fixed-income, commodity, and alternative investment indexes, each offering specialized options. Understanding index construction and management is crucial for proper use.
