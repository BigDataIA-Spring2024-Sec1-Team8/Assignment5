## Summary

Value added is defined as the difference between the return on the managed portfolio and the return on a passive benchmark portfolio. This difference in returns might be positive or negative after the fact but would be expected to be positive before the fact or active management would not be justified., Value added is related to active weights in the portfolio, defined as differences between the various asset weights in the managed portfolio and their weights in the benchmark portfolio. Individual assets can be overweighted (have positive active weights) or underweighted (have negative active weights), but the complete set of active weights sums to zero., Positive value added is generated when positive-active-weight assets have larger returns than negative-active-weight assets. By defining individual asset active returns as the difference between the asset total return and the benchmark return, value added is shown to be positive if and only if end-of-period realized active asset returns are positively correlated with the active asset weights established at the beginning of the period., Value added can come from a variety of active portfolio management decisions, including security selection, asset class allocation, and even further decompositions into economic sector weightings and geographic or country weights., The Sharpe ratio measures reward per unit of risk in absolute returns, whereas the information ratio measures reward per unit of risk in benchmark relative returns. Either ratio can be applied ex ante to expected returns or ex post to realized returns. The information ratio is a key criterion on which to evaluate actively managed portfolios., Higher information ratio portfolios can be used to create higher Sharpe ratio portfolios. The optimal amount of active management that maximizes a portfolio’s Sharpe ratio is positively related to the assumed forecasting accuracy or ex ante information coefficient of the active strategy., The active risk of an actively managed strategy can be adjusted to its desired level by combining it with a position in the benchmark. Furthermore, once an investor has identified the maximum Sharpe ratio portfolio, the total volatility of a portfolio can be adjusted to its desired level by combining it with cash (two-fund separation concept)., The fundamental law of active portfolio management began as a conceptual framework for evaluating the potential value added of various investment strategies, but it has also emerged as an operational system for measuring the essential components of those active strategies., Although the fundamental law provides a framework for analyzing investment strategies, the essential inputs of forecasted asset returns and risks still require judgment in formulating the expected returns., The fundamental law separates the expected value added, or portfolio return relative to the benchmark return, into the basic elements of the strategy: skill as measured by the information coefficient, structuring of the portfolio as measured by the transfer coefficient, breadth of the strategy measured by the number of independent decisions per year, and aggressiveness measured by the benchmark tracking risk. The last three of these four elements may be beyond the control of the investor if they are specified by investment policy or constrained by regulation., skill as measured by the information coefficient,, structuring of the portfolio as measured by the transfer coefficient,, breadth of the strategy measured by the number of independent decisions per year, and, aggressiveness measured by the benchmark tracking risk., The fundamental law has been applied in settings that include the selection of country equity markets in a global equity fund and the timing of credit and duration exposures in a fixed-income fund., The fundamental law of active management has limitations, including uncertainty about the ex ante information coefficient and the conceptual definition of breadth as the number of independent decisions by the investor.

## Technical Note

**Summary:**
Value added in active management is the difference between managed and benchmark portfolio returns, generated when positive active weights correlate with realized active returns. The information ratio measures benchmark-relative reward per unit of risk, while the Sharpe ratio measures absolute return reward per unit of total risk. The fundamental law of active management separates value added into skill (information coefficient), portfolio structuring (transfer coefficient), breadth (decisions per year), and risk tolerance (active risk). The information ratio is crucial for manager selection and determining optimal active risk. Active strategies can be compared using the fundamental law, with market timing and security selection being two common approaches. The fundamental law provides a framework for analysis but requires subjective inputs for forecasted returns and risks. Despite limitations in input uncertainty and breadth definition, the fundamental law has been successfully applied in various settings.
