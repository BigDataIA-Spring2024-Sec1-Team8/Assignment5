## Summary

The sales proceeds of a bond issue are determined by discounting future cash payments using the market rate of interest at the time of issuance (effective interest rate). The reported interest expense on bonds is based on the effective interest rate., Future cash payments on bonds usually include periodic interest payments (made at the stated interest rate or coupon rate) and the principal amount at maturity., When the market rate of interest equals the coupon rate for the bonds, the bonds will sell at par (i.e., at a price equal to the face value). When the market rate of interest is higher than the bonds’ coupon rate, the bonds will sell at a discount. When the market rate of interest is lower than the bonds’ coupon rate, the bonds will sell at a premium., An issuer amortises any issuance discount or premium on bonds over the life of the bonds., If a company redeems bonds before maturity, it reports a gain or loss on debt extinguishment computed as the net carrying amount of the bonds (including bond issuance costs under IFRS) less the amount required to redeem the bonds., Debt covenants impose restrictions on borrowers, such as limitations on future borrowing or requirements to maintain a minimum debt-to-equity ratio., The carrying amount of bonds is typically the amortised historical cost, which can differ from their fair value., Companies are required to disclose the fair value of financial liabilities, including debt. Although permitted to do so, few companies opt to report debt at fair values on the balance sheet.

## Technical Note

**Technical Note Summary**

**Key Points:**

**Bonds**
- Initial recognition: Recorded at proceeds received
- Initial measurement: Face value discounted at market interest rate
- Subsequent measurement: Amortize discounts/premiums over bond life

**Interest Expense**
- Calculated using effective interest method
- Amortizes discounts and premiums
- Interest payments based on stated rate or coupon rate

**Bond Issuance and Sale**
- Bonds sell at par if market interest rate = coupon rate
- Bonds sell at a discount if market interest rate > coupon rate
- Bonds sell at a premium if market interest rate < coupon rate

**Derecognition of Debt**
- Bonds redeemed before maturity: Gain/loss on debt extinguishment

**Debt Covenants**
- Restrictions on borrowers to protect creditors

**Financial Statement Presentation**
- Bonds carried at amortized historical cost (typically)
- Fair value disclosure required (optional reporting)

**Leasing**
- Motivations: Avoid upfront capital costs, flexibility
- Lessee: Capitalizes lease assets, recognizes lease expense

**Pension Plans**
- Defined contribution: Employee-funded, employer contributions known
- Defined benefit: Employer-funded, benefits based on factors

**Leverage and Coverage Ratios**
- Assess company's solvency and liquidity
