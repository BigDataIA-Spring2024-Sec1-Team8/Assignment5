**Introduction**
This technical note provides an overview of the key points covered in the Learning Outcome Statement (LOS): Manage your Professional Learning credits. The LOS focuses on asset-backed securities, real estate bonds, and financial markets.

**Asset-Backed Securities**

Asset-backed securities (ABS) are financial instruments that are collateralized by a pool of underlying assets, such as auto loans, credit card receivables, or mortgages. Investors in ABS receive monthly payments of principal and interest, and the payments are typically backed by the cash flow from the underlying assets.

**Real Estate Bonds**

Real estate bonds are debt instruments that are secured by real estate properties. Real estate bonds typically offer higher yields than corporate bonds, but they also carry higher risks. The performance of real estate bonds is influenced by factors such as property values, interest rates, and the economic environment.

**Financial Markets**

Financial markets are venues where buyers and sellers of financial instruments, such as stocks, bonds, and currencies, interact. Monitoring financial markets can help investors identify investment opportunities and manage risks. Investors should be aware of the various types of financial markets, the risks associated with each market, and the factors that influence market movements.

**Additional Notes**

* The LOS also includes a reference to the "PL Record" and "Categories." These concepts are not covered in this technical note.
* The LOS is from a learning platform called "Professional Learning." The content of the LOS may vary depending on the specific learning objectives of the platform.
