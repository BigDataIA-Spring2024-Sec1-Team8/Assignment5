**Summary**

The CFA Institute's Professional Conduct Program enforces the Code of Ethics and Standards, which provide the framework for ethical behavior in the investment profession. The Code consists of six components: Integrity, Objectivity, Professionalism, Skill and Diligence, Fairness, and Responsibility. Each component is further defined by seven Standards of Professional Conduct, covering specific ethical responsibilities and sub-sections that provide additional guidance. These ethical responsibilities include: acting ethically, placing client interests first, protecting confidential information, preventing conflicts of interest, disclosing material facts, best execution, and maintaining professional skills. By adhering to these ethical standards, CFA members demonstrate their commitment to integrity and professionalism in the investment industry.
