# Introduction

The member should be able to: describe issues in performance appraisal of alternative investments, and calculate and interpret returns of alternative investments both before and after fees.

## Summary

Conducting performance appraisal on alternative investments can be challenging because these investments are often characterized by asymmetric risk–return profiles, limited portfolio transparency, illiquidity, product complexity, and complex fee structures., Traditional risk and return measures (such as mean return, standard deviation of returns, and beta) may provide an inadequate picture of alternative investments’ risk and return characteristics. Moreover, these measures may be unreliable or not representative of specific investments., A variety of ratios can be calculated to review the performance of alternative investments, including the Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, Calmar ratio, and mean adequacy ratio (MAR). The internal rate of return (IRR) and multiple on invested capital (MOIC) calculations are often used to evaluate private equity investments, and the cap rate is often used to evaluate real estate investments., Redemption rules, lockup periods, and timing differences in reporting can bring special challenges to performance appraisal of alternative investments.

## Technical Note

**Technical Note: Issues in Performance Appraisal of Alternative Investments**

**Key Points:**

* **Asymmetric Risk-Return Profiles:** Alternative investments often exhibit non-linear risk-return relationships, making traditional risk measures unsuitable.
* **Limited Transparency:** Lack of timely and accurate information can hinder accurate performance evaluation.
* **Illiquidity:** Unlike liquid investments, alternative investments may be difficult to sell or redeem, impacting return calculations.
* **Product Complexity:** Understanding the underlying strategies and structures of alternative investments is crucial for effective appraisal.
* **Complex Fee Structures:** Performance fees, management fees, and other expenses can significantly affect net returns.

**Common Performance Measures:**

| **Measure** | **Purpose** |
|---|---|
| Sharpe Ratio | Risk-adjusted return based on excess return over risk-free rate |
| Sortino Ratio | Risk-adjusted return considering only downside risk |
| Calmar Ratio | Risk-adjusted return considering worst drawdown |
| Mean Adequacy Ratio | Proportion of time returns exceeded a target |
| Internal Rate of Return (IRR) | Discount rate that equates the net present value of cash flows to zero |
| Multiple on Invested Capital (MOIC) | Return on investment expressed as a multiple of capital invested |
| Cap Rate | Annual return on real estate investment based on income and property value |

**Challenges in Performance Appraisal:**

* **Redemption Rules and Lockup Periods:** Restrictions on withdrawals can affect return calculations and liquidity.
* **Timing Differences in Reporting:** Variations in reporting schedules can lead to inconsistent performance metrics.

**Interpretation of Returns:**

* Returns should be evaluated both before and after fees to assess the impact of expenses.
* Contextual factors, such as investment objectives and market conditions, should be considered when interpreting returns.
