**Portfolio Management Summary**

A portfolio approach to investing involves diversifying investments across multiple securities to reduce risk while maintaining return potential. The portfolio management process includes defining client needs, allocating assets, analyzing securities, constructing the portfolio, monitoring and rebalancing it, and measuring performance. Investors can be individuals or institutions, with varying needs and characteristics. Defined contribution pension plans allow employees to contribute to their own accounts, while defined benefit plans guarantee a specific retirement income.

The asset management industry manages investments for clients, offering active or passive management strategies. Traditional and alternative asset management firms blur the lines between these categories. The industry has seen trends towards passive investing, big data utilization, and robo-advisors. Mutual funds are pooled investment vehicles that offer diversified exposure to a specific asset class or strategy. They differ from other pooled investment products, such as ETFs, hedge funds, and private equity funds, in terms of structure, fees, and investment strategies.
