# Introduction

The member should be able to: calculate the yearly cash flows of expansion and replacement capital projects and evaluate how the choice of depreciation method affects those cash flows; explain how inflation affects capital budgeting analysis; evaluate capital projects and determine the optimal capital project in situations of 1) mutually exclusive projects with unequal lives, using either the least common multiple of lives approach or the equivalent annual annuity approach, and 2) capital rationing; explain how sensitivity analysis, scenario analysis, and Monte Carlo simulation can be used to assess the standalone risk of a capital project; describe types of real options relevant to a capital project; describe common capital budgeting pitfalls.

## Summary

Analysts often organize the cash flows for capital budgeting in tables, summing all of the cash flows occurring at each point in time. These totals are then used to find an NPV or IRR. Alternatively, tables collecting cash flows by type can be used. Equations for the capital budgeting cash flows are as follows: Initial outlay: Outlay = FCInv + NWCInv − Sal 0 + t ( Sal 0 − B 0 ) Annual after-tax operating cash flow: CF = ( S − C − D ) ( 1 − t ) + D, or CF = ( S − C ) ( 1 − t ) + t D Terminal year after-tax non-operating cash flow: TNOCF = Sal T + NWCInv − t ( Sal T − B T ), Depreciation schedules affect taxable income, taxes paid, and after-tax cash flows, and therefore capital budgeting valuations., When inflation exists, the analyst should perform capital budgeting analysis in “nominal” terms if cash flows are nominal and in “real” terms if cash flows are real., Inflation reduces the value of depreciation tax savings (unless the tax system adjusts depreciation for inflation). Inflation reduces the value of fixed payments to bondholders. Inflation usually does not affect all revenues and costs uniformly. Contracting with customers, suppliers, employees, and sources of capital can be complicated as inflation rises., Two ways of comparing mutually exclusive projects in a replacement chain are the “least common multiple of lives” approach and the “equivalent annual annuity” approach., For the least common multiple of lives approach, the analyst extends the time horizon of analysis so that the lives of both projects will divide exactly into the horizon. The projects are replicated over this horizon, and the NPV for the total cash flows over the least common multiple of lives is used to evaluate the investments., The equivalent annual annuity is the annuity payment (series of equal annual payments over the project’s life) that is equivalent in value to the project’s actual cash flows. Analysts find the present value of all of the cash flows for an investment (the NPV) and then calculate an annuity payment that has a value equivalent to the NPV., With capital rationing, the company’s capital budget has a size constraint. Under “hard” capital rationing, the budget is fixed. In the case of hard rationing, managers use trial and error and sometimes mathematical programming to find the optimal set of projects. In that situation, it is best to use the NPV or PI valuation methods., Sensitivity analysis calculates the effect on the NPV of changes in one input variable at a time., Scenario analysis creates scenarios that consist of changes in several of the input variables and calculates the NPV for each scenario., Simulation (Monte Carlo) analysis is used to estimate probability distributions for the NPV or IRR of a capital project. Simulations randomly select values for stochastic input variables and then repeatedly calculate the project NPV and IRR to find their distributions., Real options can be classified as 1) timing options; 2) sizing options, which can be abandonment options or growth (expansion) options; 3) flexibility options, which can be price-setting options or production-flexibility options; and 4) fundamental options.

## Technical Note

**Summary:**

1. Capital budgeting cash flows can be organized by time period or type.
2. Depreciation schedules impact cash flows by affecting taxable income and taxes paid.
3. Inflation affects capital budgeting by reducing the value of depreciation tax savings and fixed payments.
4. Mutually exclusive projects with unequal lives can be compared using the least common multiple of lives or equivalent annual annuity approach.
5. Capital rationing requires trial and error or mathematical programming to find the optimal project set.
6. Sensitivity, scenario, and Monte Carlo analysis assess project risk by varying input variables.
7. Real options provide flexibility and value in capital projects by offering timing, sizing, flexibility, and fundamental options.
8. Common capital budgeting pitfalls include cash flow errors, ignoring non-cash flows, overconfidence, and failing to consider real options.
9. Equations for capital budgeting cash flows include initial outlay, annual after-tax operating cash flow, and terminal year after-tax non-operating cash flow.
10. Inflation can complicate contracting and requires careful consideration in capital budgeting analysis.
