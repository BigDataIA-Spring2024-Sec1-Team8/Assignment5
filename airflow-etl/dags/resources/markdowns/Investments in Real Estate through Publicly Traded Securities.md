## Summary

The principal types of publicly traded real estate securities include real estate investment trusts (REITs), real estate operating companies (REOCs), and residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities (RMBS and CMBS)., Compared with other publicly traded shares, REITs typically offer higher-than-average yields and greater stability of income and returns. They are amenable to a net asset value approach to valuation because of the existence of active private markets for their real estate assets., Compared with REOCs, REITs offer higher yields and income tax exemptions but have less operating flexibility to invest in a broad range of real estate activities and less potential for growth from reinvesting their operating cash flows because of their high income-to-payout ratios., In assessing the investment merits of REITs, investors analyze the effects of trends in general economic activity, retail sales, job creation, population growth, and new supply and demand for specific types of space. Investors also pay particular attention to occupancies, leasing activity, rental rates, remaining lease terms, in-place rents compared with market rents, costs to maintain space and re-lease space, tenants’ financial health and tenant concentration in the portfolio, financial leverage, debt maturities and costs, and the quality of management and governance., Analysts make adjustments to the historical cost-based financial statements of REITs and REOCs to obtain better measures of current income and net worth. The three principal figures they calculate and use are (1) funds from operations or accounting net earnings, excluding depreciation, deferred tax charges, and gains or losses on sales of property and debt restructuring; (2) adjusted funds from operations, or funds from operations adjusted to remove straight-line rent and to provide for maintenance-type capital expenditures and leasing costs, including leasing agents’ commissions and tenants’ improvement allowances; and (3) net asset value or the difference between a real estate company’s asset and liability ranking prior to shareholders’ equity, all valued at market values instead of accounting book values., REITs and some REOCs generally return a significant portion of their income to their investors as required by law and, as a result, tend to pay high dividends. Thus, dividend discount or discounted cash flow models for valuation are also applicable. These valuation approaches are applied in the same manner as they are for shares in other industries. Usually, investors use two- or three-step dividend discount models with near-term, intermediate-term, and/or long-term growth assumptions. In discounted cash flow models, investors often use intermediate-term cash flow projections and a terminal value based on historical cash flow multiples.

## Technical Note

**Summary:**

**Types of Publicly Traded Real Estate Securities:**
- Real estate investment trusts (REITs)
- Real estate operating companies (REOCs)
- Mortgage-backed securities (RMBS and CMBS)

**Valuation of REITs:**
- Net asset value per share (NAVPS) reflects the value of REIT's assets minus liabilities.
- Funds from operations (FFO) and adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) provide cash flow metrics for valuation.

**Valuation Methods for REITs:**
- Net asset value approach estimates current market value of assets.
- Relative value approaches compare REITs to industry peers based on price-to-FFO or price-to-AFFO ratios.
- Discounted cash flow approaches project future cash flows and discount them to present value.

**Comparison of REITs to Private Vehicles:**
- REITs offer higher yields and tax advantages over REOCs.
- Private vehicles provide more operating flexibility and potential for growth.

**Advantages of Investing in Publicly Traded Real Estate:**
- Liquidity and diversification benefits
- Access to larger pool of potential investors
- Real-time market pricing information

**Disadvantages of Investing in Publicly Traded Real Estate:**
- Higher transaction costs compared to private investments
- Limited control over investment decisions
- Market volatility and potential losses
