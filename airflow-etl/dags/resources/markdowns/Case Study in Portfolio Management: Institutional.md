**Technical Note: Managing Portfolio Liquidity Risk and Constructing Portfolios for Specific Needs**

**Key Points:**

**Managing Portfolio Liquidity Risk:**

* Tools include diversification, cash reserves, and liquidity-enhancing derivatives.
* Illiquidity risk assessment considers market conditions, asset characteristics, and investment horizon.

**Capture of Illiquidity Premium:**

* Investment strategy that seeks to earn a return for holding less liquid assets.
* Requires specialized knowledge and risk management capabilities.

**Asset Allocation and Portfolio Construction:**

* Alignment of liquidity needs with risk tolerance and return expectations.
* Active management may address liquidity issues by selling illiquid assets or using derivatives.

**Asset Manager Selection:**

* Code of Ethics and Standards of Professional Conduct dictate due diligence and avoidance of conflicts of interest.
* Ethical issues include insider trading, conflicts of interest, and duty of loyalty.

**Derivatives vs. Cash Market Techniques:**

* Derivatives provide flexibility in establishing and modifying exposures without trading the underlying assets.
* Benefits of derivatives offset by associated costs, such as counterparty risk and transaction fees.

**Derivatives Overlays:**

* Tactical asset allocation strategy that manages portfolio risk and return by overlaying derivatives on existing portfolios.
* Requires understanding of derivatives and market conditions.
