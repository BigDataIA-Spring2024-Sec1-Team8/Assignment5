# Introduction

The member should be able to: define forward contracts, futures contracts, swaps, options (calls and puts), and credit derivatives and compare their basic characteristics; determine the value at expiration and profit from a long or a short position in a call or put option; and contrast forward commitments with contingent claims.

## Summary

Forwards, futures, and swaps represent firm commitments, or derivative contracts that require counterparties to exchange an underlying in the future based on an agreed-on price., Forwards are a flexible over-the-counter (OTC) derivative instrument, whereas futures are standardized and traded on an exchange with a daily settlement of contract gains and losses., Swap contracts are a firm commitment to exchange a series of cash flows in the future. Interest rate swaps are the most common type and involve the exchange of fixed interest payments for floating interest payments., Option contracts are contingent claims in which one of the counterparties determines whether and when a trade will settle. The option buyer pays a premium to the seller for the right to transact the underlying in the future at an agreed-upon exercise price., Credit default swap (CDS) contracts allow an investor to manage the risk of loss from issuer default separately from a cash bond., Market participants often create similar exposures to an underlying using firm commitments and contingent claims, although these derivative instrument types involve different payoff and profit profiles.

## Technical Note

**Forward, Futures, and Swaps**

* Forward contracts are tailored OTC instruments with customized terms.
* Futures contracts are exchange-traded standardized agreements.
* Swaps are a firm commitment to exchange cash flows on future payment dates.

**Options**

* Options are contingent claims where one party has the right to transact at a specified price and date.
* Call options provide the right to buy, while put options provide the right to sell.
* The value of an option at expiration is determined by the underlying's price and the strike price.

**Credit Derivatives**

* Credit default swaps (CDS) allow investors to manage default risk.
* CDS contracts involve a premium payment from the protection buyer to the protection seller.

**Forward Commitments vs. Contingent Claims**

* Forward contracts obligate both parties to settle at a specific future date.
* Contingent claims (options) allow the buyer to decide whether or not to transact.
* Contingent claims offer limited risk (premium paid) while forward contracts expose both parties to market risk.
