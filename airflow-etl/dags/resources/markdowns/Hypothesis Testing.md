# Introduction

The member should be able to: define a hypothesis, describe the steps of hypothesis testing, and describe and interpret the choice of the null and alternative hypotheses; compare and contrast one-tailed and two-tailed tests of hypotheses; explain a test statistic, Type I and Type II errors, a significance level, how significance levels are used in hypothesis testing, and the power of a test; explain a decision rule and the relation between confidence intervals and hypothesis tests, and determine whether a statistically significant result is also economically meaningful. explain and interpret the p-value as it relates to hypothesis testing; describe how to interpret the significance of a test in the context of multiple tests; identify the appropriate test statistic and interpret the results for a hypothesis test concerning the population mean of both large and small samples when the population is normally or approximately normally distributed and the variance is (1) known or (2) unknown; identify the appropriate test statistic and interpret the results for a hypothesis test concerning the equality of the population means of two at least approximately normally distributed populations based on independent random samples with equal assumed variances; identify the appropriate test statistic and interpret the results for a hypothesis test concerning the mean difference of two normally distributed populations; identify the appropriate test statistic and interpret the results for a hypothesis test concerning (1) the variance of a normally distributed population and (2) the equality of the variances of two normally distributed populations based on two independent random samples; compare and contrast parametric and nonparametric tests, and describe situations where each is the more appropriate type of test; explain parametric and nonparametric tests of the hypothesis that the population correlation coefficient equals zero, and determine whether the hypothesis is rejected at a given level of significance; explain tests of independence based on contingency table data.

## Summary

A hypothesis is a statement about one or more populations.

## Technical Note

**Hypothesis Testing**

**Definition:**
**Hypothesis:** A statement about the population(s) being studied.

**Hypothesis Testing Process:**
1. State the null and alternative hypotheses (H0 and Ha).
2. Calculate the test statistic.
3. Calculate the associated p-value.
4. Make a decision based on the significance level (α).

**Types of Hypotheses:**
- **One-tailed Test:** H0 has a single direction (less than or greater than).
- **Two-tailed Test:** H0 has two directions (either less than or greater than).

**Key Terms:**
- **Test Statistic:** A statistic used to evaluate the hypothesis.
- **Type I Error:** Rejecting H0 when it is true (False Positive).
- **Type II Error:** Failing to reject H0 when it is false (False Negative).
- **Significance Level (α):** The acceptable probability of Type I error.
- **p-value:** The probability of observing a test statistic as extreme or more extreme than the one calculated, assuming H0 is true.

**Relationship with Confidence Intervals:**
- Confidence intervals provide an estimated range for the parameter.
- Hypothesis tests determine whether the parameter is significantly different from a specific value.

**Statistical Power:**
- The probability of correctly rejecting H0 when it is false.
- Higher sample size and larger effect size increase power.

**Parametric vs Nonparametric Tests:**
- **Parametric:** Assume the population follows a specific distribution (e.g., normal).
- **Nonparametric:** Do not make assumptions about the population distribution.

**Contingency Table Tests:**
- Evaluate the relationship between categorical variables.
- Can test for independence, homogeneity, or other associations.
