## Technical Note

**Summary**

This technical note explores the methodologies for developing inputs in equity valuation models. It compares top-down, bottom-up, and hybrid approaches for forecasting revenue through GDP growth and market growth methods. The note evaluates economies of scale and forecasts costs, including COGS, SG&A, financing, and income taxes. It discusses balance sheet modeling and the relationship between return on invested capital and competitive advantage. Porter's five forces analysis is used to assess a company's competitive position. The note also explains how to forecast under inflation or deflation and consider technological developments. Finally, it provides guidance on choosing an explicit forecast horizon and developing projections beyond the short-term horizon.
