# Introduction

The member should be able to: compare and contrast probability samples with non-probability samples and discuss applications of each to an investment problem; explain sampling error; compare and contrast simple random, stratified random, cluster, convenience, and judgmental sampling; explain the central limit theorem and its importance; calculate and interpret the standard error of the sample mean; identify and describe desirable properties of an estimator; contrast a point estimate and a confidence interval estimate of a population parameter; calculate and interpret a confidence interval for a population mean, given a normal distribution with 1) a known population variance, 2) an unknown population variance, or 3) an unknown population variance and a large sample size; describe the use of resampling (bootstrap, jackknife) to estimate the sampling distribution of a statistic. describe the issues regarding selection of the appropriate sample size, data snooping bias, sample selection bias, survivorship bias, look-ahead bias, and time-period bias.

## Summary

To draw valid inferences from a sample, the sample should be random.

## Technical Note

**Summary:**

- **Probability samples** involve random selection of subjects and allow for statistical inference to a population.
- **Non-probability samples** are not random and are less reliable for making inferences.
- **Sampling error** occurs when a sample does not accurately represent the population.
- **Simple random sampling** involves selecting each subject with equal probability.
- **Stratified random sampling** divides the population into strata and selects subjects randomly within each stratum.
- **Cluster sampling** involves randomly selecting groups of subjects to represent the population.
- **Convenience sampling** selects easily accessible subjects.
- **Judgmental sampling** uses an expert's judgment to select subjects.
- **The central limit theorem** states that the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution as sample size increases.
- **Standard error** measures the variability between sample means.
- **Point estimates** provide a single value for a population parameter.
- **Confidence intervals** indicate a range of possible values for a population parameter with a known level of confidence.
- **Resampling** techniques (bootstrap, jackknife) are used to estimate the variability of a statistic.
- **Sampling size** should consider the level of accuracy desired and the variability in the population.
- **Bias** can occur due to selective sampling, data manipulation, or time-period effects.
