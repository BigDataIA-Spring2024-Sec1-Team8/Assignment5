## Summary

Companies invest for two reasons: to maintain their existing businesses and to grow them. Projects undertaken by companies to maintain a business including operating efficiencies are (1) going concern projects and (2) regulatory/compliance projects, while (3) expansion projects and (4) other projects are undertaken by companies to strategically expand or grow their operations., Capital allocation supports the most critical investments for many corporations—their investments in long-term assets. The principles of capital allocation are also relevant and can be applied to other corporate investing and financing decisions and to security analysis and portfolio management., The typical steps companies take in the capital allocation process are (1) idea generation, (2) investment analysis, (3) capital allocation planning, and (4) postaudit and monitoring. Companies should base their capital allocation decisions on the investment project’s incremental after-tax cash flows discounted at the opportunity cost of funds. In addition, companies should ignore financing costs because both the cost of debt and the cost of other capital are captured in the discount rate used in the analysis., The NPV of an investment project is the present value of its after-tax cash flows (or the present value of its after-tax cash inflows minus the present value of its after-tax outflows) or NPV = Σ t=0 n CF t _ (1 + r) t, where the investment outlays are negative cash flows included in CFt, and r is the required rate of return for the investment., Microsoft Excel functions to solve for the NPV for both conventional and unconventional cash flow patterns are NPV or = NPV (rate, values), and XNPV or = XNPV (rate, values, dates), where “rate” is the discount rate, “values” are the cash flows, and “dates” are the dates of each of the cash flows., The IRR is the discount rate that makes the present value of all future cash flows of the project sum to zero. This equation can be solved for the IRR: Σ t=0 n CF t _ (1 + IRR) t = 0., Using Microsoft Excel functions to solve for IRR, the functions are

## Technical Note

**Summary**

Companies make capital investments to maintain or grow their businesses. The capital allocation process involves generating ideas, analyzing investments, allocating capital, and monitoring performance. Companies should base decisions on incremental after-tax cash flows discounted at the opportunity cost of funds, ignoring financing costs.

Net present value (NPV) is the sum of present values of after-tax cash flows, with Microsoft Excel functions NPV or XNPV. Internal rate of return (IRR) is the discount rate that makes the NPV zero, with Excel functions IRR or XIRR.

Advantages of NPV include simplicity and direct consideration of cash flows. Advantages of IRR include its accounting for the time value of money and the ability to compare projects with different lifespans.

Common capital allocation pitfalls include overestimating cash flows, underestimating costs, and neglecting financing costs. Investments generally increase company value and share price, though not always.

Real options include the options to abandon, defer, expand, or contract an investment project.
