## Summary

Economic market structures can be grouped into four categories: perfect competition, monopolistic competition, oligopoly, and monopoly., The categories differ because of the following characteristics: The number of producers is many in perfect and monopolistic competition, few in oligopoly, and one in monopoly. The degree of product differentiation, the pricing power of the producer, the barriers to entry of new producers, and the level of non-price competition (e.g., advertising) are all low in perfect competition, moderate in monopolistic competition, high in oligopoly, and generally highest in monopoly., A financial analyst must understand the characteristics of market structures in order to better forecast a firm’s future profit stream., The optimal marginal revenue equals marginal cost. However, only in perfect competition does the marginal revenue equal price. In the remaining structures, price generally exceeds marginal revenue because a firm can sell more units only by reducing the per unit price., The quantity sold is highest in perfect competition. The price in perfect competition is usually lowest, but this depends on factors such as demand elasticity and increasing returns to scale (which may reduce the producer’s marginal cost). Monopolists, oligopolists, and producers in monopolistic competition attempt to differentiate their products so that they can charge higher prices., Typically, monopolists sell a smaller quantity at a higher price. Investors may benefit from being shareholders of monopolistic firms that have large margins and substantial positive cash flows., Competitive firms do not earn economic profit. There will be a market compensation for the rental of capital and of management services, but the lack of pricing power implies that there will be no extra margins., While in the short run firms in any market structure can have economic profits, the more competitive a market is and the lower the barriers to entry, the faster the extra profits will fade. In the long run, new entrants shrink margins and push the least efficient firms out of the market., Oligopoly is characterized by the importance of strategic behavior. Firms can change the price, quantity, quality, and advertisement of the product to gain an advantage over their competitors. Several types of equilibrium (e.g., Nash, Cournot, kinked demand curve) may occur that affect the likelihood of each of the incumbents (and potential entrants in the long run) having economic profits. Price wars may be started to force weaker competitors to abandon the market., Measuring market power is complicated. Ideally, econometric estimates of the elasticity of demand and supply should be computed. However, because of the lack of reliable data and the fact that elasticity changes over time (so that past data may not apply to the current situation), regulators and economists often use simpler measures. The concentration ratio is simple, but the HHI, with little more computation required, often produces a better figure for decision making.

## Technical Note

**Summary:**

Market structures vary based on characteristics such as number of producers, product differentiation, and barriers to entry. Perfect competition has numerous producers, homogeneous products, and low barriers; monopolistic competition has similar characteristics but with some product differentiation; oligopoly has a small number of producers with high entry barriers; and pure monopoly has a single producer with no competition. Price, marginal revenue, and marginal cost interact differently under each structure, impacting economic profit. Firms aim to maximize profits by setting prices and output optimally. Long-run equilibrium varies depending on the structure, with more competitive markets tending towards lower prices and lower profits. Pricing strategies vary among structures, with monopolies and oligopolies often engaging in non-price competition. Concentration measures can provide insights into market structure, but their accuracy is limited. Understanding market structures enables analysts to forecast firms' profitability and identify potential risks and opportunities.
