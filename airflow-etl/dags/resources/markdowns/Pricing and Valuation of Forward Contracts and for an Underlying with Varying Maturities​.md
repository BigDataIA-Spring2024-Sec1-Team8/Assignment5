# Introduction

The member should be able to: explain how the value and price of a forward contract are determined at initiation, during the life of the contract, and at expiration; and explain how forward rates are determined for an underlying with a term structure and describe their uses.

## Summary

A forward commitment price agreed upon at contract inception remains fixed and establishes the basis on which the underlying asset (or cash) will be exchanged in the future versus the spot price at maturity., For an underlying asset that does not generate cash flows, the value of a long forward commitment before expiration is equal to the current spot price of the underlying asset minus the present value of the forward price discounted at the risk-free rate. The reverse is true for a short forward commitment. Foreign exchange represents a special case in which the spot versus forward price is a function of the difference between risk-free rates across currencies., For an underlying asset with additional costs and benefits, the forward contract MTM value is adjusted by the sum of the present values of all additional cash flows through maturity., Underlying assets with a term structure, such as interest rates, have different rates or prices for different times-to-maturity. These zero or spot and forward rates are derived from coupon bonds and market reference rates and establish the building blocks of interest rate derivatives pricing., Implied forward rates represent a breakeven reinvestment rate linking short-dated and long-dated zero-coupon bonds over a specific period., A forward rate agreement (FRA) is a contract in which counterparties agree to apply a specific interest rate to a future period.

## Technical Note

**Technical Note: Forward Contract Valuation and Forward Rates**

**Value and Price of Forward Contracts**

* **Initiation:** Forward price equals spot price.
* **During Life:** Value of forward commitment depends on underlying asset type and additional cash flows.
* **Expiration:** Commitment price fixed at initiation, settles against spot price at maturity.

**Forward Rates for Term Structure Assets**

* **Zero and Spot Rates:** Derived from coupon bonds and reference rates.
* **Implied Forward Rates:** Breakeven reinvestment rates linking zero-coupon bonds.
* **Uses:** Building blocks for interest rate derivative pricing and hedging.

**Forward Rate Agreement (FRA)**

* **Definition:** Contract to apply a specific interest rate to a future period.
* **Purpose:** Hedge interest rate risk or speculate on future rates.
