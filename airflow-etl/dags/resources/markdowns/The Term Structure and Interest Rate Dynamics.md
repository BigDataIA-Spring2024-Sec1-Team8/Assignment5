## Summary

The spot rate for a given maturity can be expressed as a geometric average of the short-term rate and a series of forward rates., Forward rates are above (below) spot rates when the spot curve is upward (downward) sloping, whereas forward rates are equal to spot rates when the spot curve is flat., If forward rates are realized, then all bonds, regardless of maturity, will have the same one-period realized return, which is the first-period spot rate., If the spot rate curve is upward sloping and is unchanged, then each bond “rolls down” the curve and earns the forward rate that rolls out of its pricing (i.e., an N-period zero-coupon bond earns the N-period forward rate as it rolls down to be a N – 1 period security). This dynamic implies an expected return in excess of short-maturity bonds (i.e., a term premium) for longer-maturity bonds if the yield curve is upward sloping., Active bond portfolio management is consistent with the expectation that today’s forward curve does not accurately reflect future spot rates., The swap curve provides another measure of the time value of money., Swaps are an essential tool frequently used by investors to hedge, take a position in, or otherwise modify interest rate risk., Bond quote conventions often use measures of spreads. Those quoted spreads can be used to determine a bond’s price., Swap curves and Treasury curves can differ because of differences in their credit exposures, liquidity, and other supply/demand factors., Market participants often use interest rate spreads between short-term government and risky rates as a barometer to evaluate relative credit and liquidity risk., The local expectations theory, liquidity preference theory, segmented markets theory, and preferred habitat theory provide traditional explanations for the shape of the yield curve., Historical yield curve movements suggest that they can be explained by a linear combination of three principal movements: level, steepness, and curvature., The volatility term structure can be measured using historical data and depicts yield curve risk. The sensitivity of a bond value to yield curve changes may make use of effective duration, key rate durations, or sensitivities to parallel, steepness, and curvature movements. Using key rate durations or sensitivities to parallel, steepness, and curvature movements allows one to measure and manage shaping risk., The term bond risk premium refers to the expected excess return of a default-free long-term bond less that of an equivalent short-term bond or the one-period risk-free rate, Several macroeconomic factors influence bond pricing and required returns such as inflation, economic growth, and monetary policy, among others., During highly uncertain market periods, investors flock to government bonds in a flight to quality that is often associated with bullish flattening, in which long-term rates fall by more than short-term rates., Investors expecting rates to fall will generally extend (shorten) portfolio duration to take advantage of expected bond price increases (decreases), When investors expect a steeper (flatter) curve under which long-term rates rise (fall) relative to short-term rates, they will sell (buy) long-term bonds and purchase (sell) short-term bonds.

## Technical Note

**Summary:**

Spot rates and forward rates are interconnected, with forward rates exceeding spot rates in an upward-sloping yield curve and vice versa. Yield to maturity represents the average annual return over a bond's life, while expected and realized returns depend on spot rate movements. Zero-coupon rates can be bootstrapped from par curves. Active bond portfolio management assumes forward rates do not accurately reflect future spot rates. Rolling down the yield curve involves holding bonds as they mature to earn future forward rates. The swap rate curve measures the time value of money and is used in valuation and risk management. Short-term interest rate spreads indicate credit and liquidity risk. Traditional term structure theories explain yield curve shapes, including the local expectations theory, liquidity preference theory, segmented markets theory, and preferred habitat theory. Yield volatilities vary by maturity, influencing price volatility. Economic factors, such as inflation and monetary policy, affect bond pricing and required returns.
