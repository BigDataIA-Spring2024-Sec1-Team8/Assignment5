**Learning Outcome Summary**

**Summary**

* Professional Learning (PL) credits are essential for maintaining and advancing professional competence.
* Bonds are a type of fixed-income investment that pay regular interest payments and return the principal amount at maturity.
* Bond valuation involves calculating the current market value of a bond based on its future cash flows.

**Key Points**

**1. Managing Professional Learning Credits**

* PL credits track professional development activities.
* They are used to maintain certifications, enhance skills, and meet continuing education requirements.

**2. Understanding Bonds**

* Bonds represent loans made to a company or government.
* They typically pay interest semi-annually or annually.
* The principal amount is repaid at the bond's maturity date.

**3. Bond Valuation**

* Bond valuation uses present value techniques to calculate the value of future cash flows.
* The formula for bond valuation is:
```
Bond Value = Î£ (CF / (1 + r)^n)
```
where:
* CF = Cash flow (interest + principal repayment)
* r = Required rate of return
* n = Number of cash flows remaining
