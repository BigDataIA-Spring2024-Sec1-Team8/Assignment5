# Introduction

The member should be able to: explain the exercise value, moneyness, and time value of an option; contrast the use of arbitrage and replication concepts in pricing forward commitments and contingent claims; and identify the factors that determine the value of an option and describe how each factor affects the value of an option.

## Summary

An option’s value includes its exercise value and its time value. The exercise value is the option’s value if it were immediately exercisable, whereas the time value captures the possibility that the passage of time and the variability of the underlying price will increase the profitability of exercise at maturity., Option moneyness expresses the relationship between the underlying price and the exercise price. A put–call option is “at the money” when the underlying price equals the exercise price. An option is more likely to be exercised if it is “in the money”—with an underlying price above (for a call) or below (for a put) the exercise price—and is less likely to be exercised if it is “out of the money.”, Because of their asymmetric payoff profile, options are characterized by no-arbitrage price bounds. The lower bound is a function of the present value of the exercise price and the underlying price, whereas the upper bound is the underlying price for a call and the exercise price for a put., As in the case of forward commitments, the replication of option contracts uses a combination of long (for a call) or short (for a put) positions in an underlying asset and borrowing or lending cash., The replicating transaction for an option is based on a proportion of the underlying, which is closely associated with the moneyness of the option., The underlying price, the exercise price, the time to maturity, the risk-free rate, the volatility of the underlying price, and any income or cost associated with owning the underlying asset are key factors in determining the value of an option., Changes in the volatility of the underlying price and the time to expiration usually will have the same directional effect on put and call option values. Changes to the exercise price, the risk-free rate, and any income or cost associated with owning the underlying asset have the opposite effect on call options versus put options.

## Technical Note

**Technical Note: Option Valuation**

**Key Points:**

* **Exercise Value:** The value of the option if exercised immediately, equal to the difference between the underlying price and the exercise price.
* **Moneyness:** Describes the relationship between the underlying price and exercise price: "at the money" (equal), "in the money" (above or below exercise price), and "out of the money" (below or above exercise price).
* **Time Value:** The value of the option due to the possibility of future price changes and time decay.
* **Arbitrage Pricing Bounds:** Options have no-arbitrage price bounds based on the underlying price and exercise price.
* **Replication Pricing:** Options can be replicated using a combination of underlying asset positions and cash, providing an alternative pricing method.
* **Factors Affecting Option Value:**
    * Underlying price
    * Exercise price
    * Time to maturity
    * Risk-free rate
    * Volatility of the underlying price
    * Income/cost of owning the underlying asset
* Volatility and time to expiration generally have the same effect on call and put option values.
* Exercise price, risk-free rate, and income/cost of ownership have opposite effects on call and put option values.
