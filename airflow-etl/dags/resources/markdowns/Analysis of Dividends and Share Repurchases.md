## Summary

Dividends can take the form of regular or irregular cash payments, stock dividends, or stock splits. Only cash dividends are payments to shareholders. Stock dividends and splits merely carve equity into smaller pieces and do not create wealth for shareholders. Reverse stock splits usually occur after a stock has dropped to a very low price and do not affect shareholder wealth., Regular cash dividends—unlike irregular cash dividends, stock splits, and stock dividends—represent a commitment to pay cash to stockholders on a quarterly, semiannual, or annual basis., There are three general theories on investor preference for dividends. The first, MM, argues that given perfect markets dividend policy is irrelevant. The second, “bird in hand” theory, contends that investors value a dollar of dividends today more than uncertain capital gains in the future. The third theory argues that in countries in which dividends are taxed at higher rates than capital gains, taxable investors prefer that companies reinvest earnings in profitable growth opportunities or repurchase shares so they receive more of the return in the form of capital gains., An argument for dividend irrelevance given perfect markets is that corporate dividend policy is irrelevant because shareholders can create their preferred cash flow stream by selling the company’s shares (“homemade dividends”)., Dividend declarations may provide information to current and prospective shareholders regarding management’s confidence in the prospects of the company. Initiating a dividend or increasing a dividend sends a positive signal, whereas cutting a dividend or omitting a dividend typically sends a negative signal. In addition, some institutional and individual shareholders see regular cash dividend payments as a measure of investment quality., Payment of dividends can help reduce the agency conflicts between managers and shareholders, but it also can worsen conflicts of interest between shareholders and debtholders., Empirically, several factors appear to influence dividend policy, including investment opportunities for the company, the volatility expected in its future earnings, financial flexibility, tax considerations, flotation costs, and contractual and legal restrictions., Under double taxation systems, dividends are taxed at both the corporate and shareholder level. Under tax imputation systems, a shareholder receives a tax credit on dividends for the tax paid on corporate profits. Under split-rate taxation systems, corporate profits are taxed at different rates depending on whether the profits are retained or paid out in dividends., Companies with outstanding debt often are restricted in the amount of dividends they can pay because of debt covenants and legal restrictions. Some institutions require that a company pay a dividend to be on their “approved” investment list. If a company funds capital expenditures by borrowing while paying earnings out in dividends, it will incur flotation costs on new debt issues., Using a stable dividend policy, a company tries to align its dividend growth rate to the company’s long-term earnings growth rate. Dividends may increase even in years when earnings decline, and dividends will increase at a lower rate than earnings in boom years., A stable dividend policy can be represented by a gradual adjustment process in which the expected dividend is equal to last year’s dividend per share plus [(Expected earnings × Target payout ratio − Previous dividend) × Adjustment factor]., Using a constant dividend payout ratio policy, a company applies a target dividend payout ratio to current earnings; therefore, dividends are more volatile than with a stable dividend policy., Share repurchases, or buybacks, most often occur in the open market. Alternatively, tender offers occur at a fixed price or at a price range through a Dutch auction. Shareholders who do not tender increase their relative position in the company. Direct negotiations with major shareholders to get them to sell their positions are less common because they could destroy value for remaining stockholders., Share repurchases made with excess cash have the potential to increase earnings per share, whereas share repurchases made with borrowed funds can increase, decrease, or not affect earnings per share depending on the company’s after-tax borrowing rate and earnings yield., A share repurchase is equivalent to the payment of a cash dividend of equal amount in its effect on total shareholders’ wealth, all other things being equal., If the buyback market price per share is greater (less) than the book value per share, then the book value per share will decrease (increase)., Companies can repurchase shares in lieu of increasing cash dividends. Share repurchases usually offer company management more flexibility than cash dividends by not establishing the expectation that a particular level of cash distribution will be maintained., Companies can pay regular cash dividends supplemented by share repurchases. In years of extraordinary increases in earnings, share repurchases can substitute for special cash dividends., On the one hand, share repurchases can signal that company officials think their shares are undervalued. On the other hand, share repurchases could send a negative signal that the company has few positive NPV opportunities., Analysts are interested in how safe a company’s dividend is, specifically whether the company’s earnings and, more importantly, its cash flow are sufficient to sustain the payment of the dividend., Early warning signs of whether a company can sustain its dividend include the dividend coverage ratio, the level of dividend yield, whether the company borrows to pay the dividend, and the company’s past dividend record.

## Technical Note

**Summary:**

Dividends can be regular cash payments, extra payments, liquidating payments, stock dividends, or stock splits. Only regular cash dividends represent actual payments to shareholders. Dividend theories include the MM theory (dividend policy is irrelevant), the "bird in hand" theory (investors prefer dividends over capital gains), and the tax-based theory (tax implications influence dividend preference). Dividend declarations can signal management's confidence or concerns. Agency costs can affect payout policies, as can investment opportunities, earnings volatility, and tax considerations. Under double taxation systems, dividends are taxed twice, while imputation systems provide tax credits. Constant dividend payout ratios apply a target ratio to current earnings, while stable dividend policies align dividend growth with long-term earnings growth. Share repurchases can increase or decrease earnings per share depending on financing methods. Companies choose between dividends and repurchases based on flexibility, signaling, and tax implications. Dividend coverage ratios assess dividend sustainability, and companies with declining earnings or high dividend yields may be at risk of cutting dividends.
