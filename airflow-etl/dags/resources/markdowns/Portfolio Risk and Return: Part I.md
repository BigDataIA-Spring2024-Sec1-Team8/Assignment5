# Introduction

The member should be able to: calculate and interpret major return measures and describe their appropriate uses; compare the money-weighted and time-weighted rates of return and evaluate the performance of portfolios based on these measures; describe characteristics of the major asset classes that investors consider in forming portfolios; calculate and interpret the mean, variance, and covariance (or correlation) of asset returns based on historical data; explain risk aversion and its implications for portfolio selection; calculate and interpret portfolio standard deviation; describe the effect on a portfolio’s risk of investing in assets that are less than perfectly correlated; describe and interpret the minimum-variance and efficient frontiers of risky assets and the global minimum-variance portfolio; explain the selection of an optimal portfolio, given an investor’s utility (or risk aversion) and the capital allocation line.

## Summary

Holding period return is most appropriate for a single, predefined holding period., Multiperiod returns can be aggregated in many ways. Each return computation has special applications for evaluating investments., Risk-averse investors make investment decisions based on the risk–return trade-off, maximizing return for the same risk, and minimizing risk for the same return. They may be concerned, however, by deviations from a normal return distribution and from assumptions of financial markets’ operational efficiency., Investors are risk averse, and historical data confirm that financial markets price assets for risk-averse investors., The risk of a two-asset portfolio is dependent on the proportions of each asset, their standard deviations and the correlation (or covariance) between the assets’ returns. As the number of assets in a portfolio increases, the correlation among asset risks becomes a more important determinate of portfolio risk., Combining assets with low correlations reduces portfolio risk., The two-fund separation theorem allows us to separate decision making into two steps. In the first step, the optimal risky portfolio and the capital allocation line are identified, which are the same for all investors. In the second step, investor risk preferences enable us to find a unique optimal investor portfolio for each investor., The addition of a risk-free asset creates portfolios that are dominant to portfolios of risky assets in all cases except for the optimal risky portfolio.

## Technical Note

**Technical Note: Understanding Major Return Measures and Portfolio Analysis**

**Key Points:**

* **Return Measures:** Different types of returns provide insights for specific investment horizons (holding period return, multiperiod returns).
* **Risk Aversion:** Investors are risk-averse and prioritize maximizing returns for given risk levels or minimizing risk for given return targets.
* **Portfolio Risk:** The risk of a portfolio depends on the risk of each asset, their weights, and their correlation.
* **Diversification:** Combining assets with low correlations reduces portfolio risk.
* **Two-Fund Separation Theorem:** Optimal portfolio selection involves the efficient frontier of risky assets and the allocation to the risk-free asset.
* **Portfolio Selection:** Investors select optimal portfolios based on their risk aversion and the capital allocation line.
* **Major Asset Classes:** Investors consider characteristics of asset classes (e.g., stocks, bonds, real estate) when forming portfolios.
* **Statistical Measures:** Mean, variance, and covariance (or correlation) provide quantitative measures of asset returns.
* **Efficient Frontier:** The efficient frontier represents the optimal combinations of risky assets that maximize return for a given risk level.
* **Optimal Portfolio:** The optimal portfolio balances the risk-return trade-off based on each investor's risk aversion and utility function.
