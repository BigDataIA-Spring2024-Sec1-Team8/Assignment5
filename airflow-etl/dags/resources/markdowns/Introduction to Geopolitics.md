**Geopolitics: Cooperation vs. Competition**

Geopolitics is the study of how geography influences political and international relations. Key actors in geopolitics are governments, organizations, and individuals who interact on the global stage. Geopolitics plays a vital role in globalization, as it shapes the distribution of power, resources, and influence among nations.

**Tools of Geopolitics**

Geopolitics employs various tools to influence global affairs. These include economic sanctions, diplomatic pressure, military force, and propaganda. The use of these tools can significantly impact regions and economies.

**Geopolitical Risk**

Geopolitical risk refers to the potential for political events to disrupt economic stability. This risk can arise from conflicts between nations, changes in government policies, or other factors that destabilize the global order.

**Impact on Investments**

Geopolitical risks can have a significant impact on investments, as they can create uncertainty and volatility in markets. Investors must consider geopolitical risks when making investment decisions to mitigate potential losses.
