## Summary

Financial reporting quality can be thought of as spanning a continuum from the highest (containing information that is relevant, correct, complete, and unbiased) to the lowest (containing information that is not just biased or incomplete but possibly pure fabrication)., Reporting quality, the focus of this reading, pertains to the information disclosed. High-quality reporting represents the economic reality of the company’s activities during the reporting period and the company’s financial condition at the end of the period., Results quality (commonly referred to as earnings quality) pertains to the earnings and cash generated by the company’s actual economic activities and the resulting financial condition, relative to expectations of current and future financial performance. Quality earnings are regarded as being sustainable, providing a sound platform for forecasts., An aspect of financial reporting quality is the degree to which accounting choices are conservative or aggressive. “Aggressive” typically refers to choices that aim to enhance the company’s reported performance and financial position by inflating the amount of revenues, earnings, and/or operating cash flow reported in the period; or by decreasing expenses for the period and/or the amount of debt reported on the balance sheet., Conservatism in financial reports can result from either (1) accounting standards that specifically require a conservative treatment of a transaction or an event or (2) judgments made by managers when applying accounting standards that result in conservative results., Managers may be motivated to issue less-than-high-quality financial reports in order to mask poor performance, to boost the stock price, to increase personal compensation, and/or to avoid violation of debt covenants., Conditions that are conducive to the issuance of low-quality financial reports include a cultural environment that result in fewer or less transparent financial disclosures, book/tax conformity that shifts emphasis toward legal compliance and away from fair presentation, and limited capital markets regulation., Mechanisms that discipline financial reporting quality include the free market and incentives for companies to minimize cost of capital, auditors, contract provisions specifically tailored to penalize misreporting, and enforcement by regulatory entities., Pro forma earnings (also commonly referred to as non-GAAP or non-IFRS earnings) adjust earnings as reported on the income statement. Pro forma earnings that exclude negative items are a hallmark of aggressive presentation choices., Companies are required to make additional disclosures when presenting any non-GAAP or non-IFRS metric., Managers’ considerable flexibility in choosing their companies’ accounting policies and in formulating estimates provides opportunities for aggressive accounting., Examples of accounting choices that affect earnings and balance sheets include inventory cost flow assumptions, estimates of uncollectible accounts receivable, estimated realizability of deferred tax assets, depreciation method, estimated salvage value of depreciable assets, and estimated useful life of depreciable assets., Cash from operations is a metric of interest to investors that can be enhanced by operating choices, such as stretching accounts payable, and potentially by classification choices.

## Technical Note

**Summary:**

Financial reporting quality refers to the accuracy, completeness, and fairness of financial information disclosed, while results quality focuses on the sustainability and transparency of earnings and cash flow. Conservative accounting methods aim to understate assets and overstate liabilities, while aggressive accounting aims to inflate financial performance. Motivations for low-quality reporting include masking poor performance or boosting stock prices. Conditions that facilitate low-quality reporting include limited transparency, book-tax conformity, and weak regulation. Disciplining mechanisms include market forces, auditors, contractual penalties, and regulatory enforcement. Non-GAAP measures and accounting choices provide opportunities for earnings management. Cash flow can be manipulated through operating and classification choices. Accounting warning signs and detection methods help identify financial reporting manipulation.
