## Summary

Commodities are a diverse asset class comprising various sectors: energy, grains, industrial (base) metals, livestock, precious metals, and softs (cash crops). Each of these sectors has a number of characteristics that are important in determining the supply and demand for each commodity, including ease of storage, geopolitics, and weather., Fundamental analysis of commodities relies on analyzing supply and demand for each of the products as well as estimating the reaction to the inevitable shocks to their equilibrium or underlying direction., The life cycle of commodities varies considerably depending on the economic, technical, and structural (i.e., industry, value chain) profile of each commodity as well as the sector. A short life cycle allows for relatively rapid adjustment to outside events, whereas a long life cycle generally limits the ability of the market to react., The valuation of commodities relative to that of equities and bonds can be summarized by noting that equities and bonds represent financial assets whereas commodities are physical assets. The valuation of commodities is not based on the estimation of future profitability and cash flows but rather on a discounted forecast of future possible prices based on such factors as the supply and demand of the physical item., The commodity trading environment is similar to other asset classes, with three types of trading participants: (1) informed investors/hedgers, (2) speculators, and (3) arbitrageurs., Commodities have two general pricing forms: spot prices in the physical markets and futures prices for later delivery. The spot price is the current price to deliver or purchase a physical commodity at a specific location. A futures price is an exchange-based price agreed on to deliver or receive a defined quantity and often quality of a commodity at a future date., The difference between spot and futures prices is generally called the basis. When the spot price is higher than the futures price, it is called backwardation, and when it is lower, it is called contango. Backwardation and contango are also used to describe the relationship between two futures contracts of the same commodity., Commodity contracts can be settled by either cash or physical delivery., There are three primary theories of futures returns. In insurance theory, commodity producers who are long the physical good are motived to sell the commodity for future delivery to hedge their production price risk exposure. The hedging pressure hypothesis describes when producers along with consumers seek to protect themselves from commodity market price volatility by entering into price hedges to stabilize their projected profits and cash flow. The theory of storage focuses on supply and demand dynamics of commodity inventories, including the concept of “convenience yield.”, In insurance theory, commodity producers who are long the physical good are motived to sell the commodity for future delivery to hedge their production price risk exposure., The hedging pressure hypothesis describes when producers along with consumers seek to protect themselves from commodity market price volatility by entering into price hedges to stabilize their projected profits and cash flow., The theory of storage focuses on supply and demand dynamics of commodity inventories, including the concept of “convenience yield.”, The total return of a fully collateralized commodity futures contract can be quantified as the spot price return plus the roll return plus the collateral return (risk-free rate return)., The roll return is effectively the weighted accounting difference (in percentage terms) between the near-term commodity futures contract price and the farther-term commodity futures contract price., A commodity swap is a legal contract between two parties calling for the exchange of payments over multiple dates as determined by several reference prices or indexes., The most relevant commodity swaps include excess return swaps, total return swaps, basis swaps, and variance/volatility swaps., The five primary commodity indexes based on assets are (1) the S&P GSCI; (2) the Bloomberg Commodity Index, formerly the Dow Jones–UBS Commodity Index; (3) the Deutsche Bank Liquid Commodity Index; (4) the Thomson Reuters/CoreCommodity CRB Index; and (5) the Rogers International Commodities Index., The key differentiating characteristics of commodity indexes are the breadth and selection methodology of coverage (number of commodities and sectors) included in each index, noting that some commodities have multiple reference contracts, the relative weightings assigned to each component/commodity and the related methodology for how these weights are determined, the methodology and frequency for rolling the individual futures contracts, the methodology and frequency for rebalancing the weights of the individual commodities and sectors, and the governance that determines which commodities are selected., the breadth and selection methodology of coverage (number of commodities and sectors) included in each index, noting that some commodities have multiple reference contracts,, the relative weightings assigned to each component/commodity and the related methodology for how these weights are determined,, the methodology and frequency for rolling the individual futures contracts,, the methodology and frequency for rebalancing the weights of the individual commodities and sectors, and, the governance that determines which commodities are selected.

## Technical Note

**Summary:**

Commodities are diverse assets classified into sectors like energy, grains, metals, and softs. Their life cycles vary based on economic factors. Commodity valuation differs from equities and bonds, focusing on future price forecasts. Commodity futures markets involve informed investors, speculators, and arbitrageurs. Spot and futures prices determine market dynamics, with contango or backwardation indicating price relationships. Commodity futures returns theories include insurance, hedging pressure, and storage theory. Total return for futures contracts includes spot price, roll return, and collateral return. Commodity swaps provide exposure modification. Commodity indexes differ in composition, weighting, and rolling strategies, affecting returns.
