## Summary

Defined contribution pension plans specify (define) only the amount of contribution to the plan; the eventual amount of the pension benefit to the employee will depend on the value of an employee’s plan assets at the time of retirement., Balance sheet reporting is less analytically relevant for defined contribution plans because companies make contributions to defined contribution plans as the expense arises and thus no liabilities accrue for that type of plan., Defined benefit pension plans specify (define) the amount of the pension benefit, often determined by a plan formula, under which the eventual amount of the benefit to the employee is a function of length of service and final salary., Defined benefit pension plan obligations are funded by the sponsoring company contributing assets to a pension trust, a separate legal entity. Differences exist in countries’ regulatory requirements for companies to fund defined benefit pension plan obligations., Both IFRS and US GAAP require companies to report on their balance sheet a pension liability or asset equal to the projected benefit obligation minus the fair value of plan assets. The amount of a pension asset that can be reported is subject to a ceiling., Under IFRS, the components of periodic pension cost are recognised as follows: Service cost is recognised in P&L, net interest income/expense is recognised in P&L, and remeasurements are recognised in OCI and are not amortised to future P&L., Under US GAAP, the components of periodic pension cost recognised in P&L include current service costs, interest expense on the pension obligation, and expected returns on plan assets (which reduces the cost). Other components of periodic pension cost—including past service costs, actuarial gains and losses, and differences between expected and actual returns on plan assets—are recognised in OCI and amortised to future P&L., Estimates of the future obligation under defined benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefits are sensitive to numerous assumptions, including discount rates, assumed annual compensation increases, expected return on plan assets, and assumed health care cost inflation., Employee compensation packages are structured to fulfill varied objectives, including satisfying employees’ needs for liquidity, retaining employees, and providing incentives to employees., Common components of employee compensation packages are salary, bonuses, and share-based compensation., Share-based compensation serves to align employees’ interests with those of the shareholders. It includes stocks and stock options., Share-based compensation has the advantage of requiring no current-period cash outlays., Share-based compensation expense is reported at fair value under IFRS and US GAAP., The valuation technique, or option pricing model, that a company uses is an important choice in determining fair value and is disclosed., Key assumptions and input into option pricing models include such items as exercise price, stock price volatility, estimated life of each award, estimated number of options that will be forfeited, dividend yield, and the risk-free rate of interest. Certain assumptions are highly subjective, such as stock price volatility or the expected life of stock options, and can greatly change the estimated fair value and thus compensation expense.

## Technical Note

**Summary:**

- Post-employment benefit plans include defined contribution and defined benefit plans.
- Defined benefit plans specify the pension benefit, funded by employer contributions to a separate trust.
- Balance sheet reporting for defined contribution plans is less relevant due to employer contributions made as expenses arise.
- Defined benefit pension obligations are measured as the present value of expected future payments and differ in reporting under IFRS and US GAAP.
- Pension cost components may be recognized in income statement or other comprehensive income under IFRS or US GAAP.
- Assumptions used in calculating pension obligations impact their magnitude and periodic pension costs.
- Share-based compensation aligns employee interests with shareholders and provides incentives.
- Stock grants and options are valued at fair value, which can significantly impact expense recognition.
- Companies' assumptions in valuing share-based compensation, such as volatility and life expectancy, influence estimated expense.
- Note disclosures provide insights into pension plan cash flows and share-based compensation arrangements.
