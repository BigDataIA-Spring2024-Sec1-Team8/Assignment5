## Summary

Multifactor models permit a nuanced view of risk that is more granular than the single-factor approach allows., Multifactor models describe the return on an asset in terms of the risk of the asset with respect to a set of factors. Such models generally include systematic factors, which explain the average returns of a large number of risky assets. Such factors represent priced risk—risk for which investors require an additional return for bearing., The arbitrage pricing theory (APT) describes the expected return on an asset (or portfolio) as a linear function of the risk of the asset with respect to a set of factors. Like the CAPM, the APT describes a financial market equilibrium; however, the APT makes less strong assumptions., The major assumptions of the APT are as follows: Asset returns are described by a factor model. With many assets to choose from, asset-specific risk can be eliminated. Assets are priced such that there are no arbitrage opportunities., Multifactor models are broadly categorized according to the type of factor used: Macroeconomic factor models Fundamental factor models Statistical factor models, In macroeconomic factor models, the factors are surprises in macroeconomic variables that significantly explain asset class (equity in our examples) returns. Surprise is defined as actual minus forecasted value and has an expected value of zero. The factors can be understood as affecting either the expected future cash flows of companies or the interest rate used to discount these cash flows back to the present and are meant to be uncorrelated., In fundamental factor models, the factors are attributes of stocks or companies that are important in explaining cross-sectional differences in stock prices. Among the fundamental factors are book-value-to-price ratio, market capitalization, price-to-earnings ratio, and financial leverage., In contrast to macroeconomic factor models, in fundamental models the factors are calculated as returns rather than surprises. In fundamental factor models, we generally specify the factor sensitivities (attributes) first and then estimate the factor returns through regressions. In macroeconomic factor models, however, we first develop the factor (surprise) series and then estimate the factor sensitivities through regressions. The factors of most fundamental factor models may be classified as company fundamental factors, company share-related factors, or macroeconomic factors., In statistical factor models, statistical methods are applied to a set of historical returns to determine portfolios that explain historical returns in one of two senses. In factor analysis models, the factors are the portfolios that best explain (reproduce) historical return covariances. In principal-components models, the factors are portfolios that best explain (reproduce) the historical return variances., Multifactor models have applications to return attribution, risk attribution, portfolio construction, and strategic investment decisions., A factor portfolio is a portfolio with unit sensitivity to a factor and zero sensitivity to other factors., Active return is the return in excess of the return on the benchmark., Active risk is the standard deviation of active returns. Active risk is also called tracking error or tracking risk. Active risk squared can be decomposed as the sum of active factor risk and active specific risk., The information ratio (IR) is mean active return divided by active risk (tracking error). The IR measures the increment in mean active return per unit of active risk., Factor models have uses in constructing portfolios that track market indexes and in alternative index construction., Traditionally, the CAPM approach would allocate assets between the risk-free asset and a broadly diversified index fund. Considering multiple sources of systematic risk may allow investors to improve on that result by tilting away from the market portfolio. Generally, investors would gain from accepting above average (below average) exposures to risks that they have a comparative advantage (comparative disadvantage) in bearing.

## Technical Note

**Summary:**

Multifactor models provide a comprehensive approach to asset return modeling by considering multiple risk dimensions. The arbitrage pricing theory (APT) underlies multifactor models, assuming asset returns are driven by systematic factor exposures. Major categories of multifactor models include macroeconomic, fundamental, and statistical models, each utilizing different types of factors. Active risk, the deviation from a benchmark, can be attributed to both factor and specific risk. The information ratio measures the return per unit of active risk. Multifactor models are valuable for tasks such as risk attribution, portfolio construction, and strategic investment decisions. By considering multiple risk dimensions, investors can potentially enhance portfolio performance by allocating assets based on risk advantages.
