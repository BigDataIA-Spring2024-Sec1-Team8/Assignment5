## Summary

Defined contribution pension plans specify (define) only the amount of contribution to the plan; the eventual amount of the pension benefit to the employee will depend on the value of an employee’s plan assets at the time of retirement., Balance sheet reporting is less analytically relevant for defined contribution plans because companies make contributions to defined contribution plans as the expense arises and thus no liabilities accrue for that type of plan., Defined benefit pension plans specify (define) the amount of the pension benefit, often determined by a plan formula, under which the eventual amount of the benefit to the employee is a function of length of service and final salary., Defined benefit pension plan obligations are funded by the sponsoring company contributing assets to a pension trust, a separate legal entity. Differences exist in countries’ regulatory requirements for companies to fund defined benefit pension plan obligations., Both IFRS and US GAAP require companies to report on their balance sheet a pension liability or asset equal to the projected benefit obligation minus the fair value of plan assets. The amount of a pension asset that can be reported is subject to a ceiling., Under IFRS, the components of periodic pension cost are recognized as follows: Service cost is recognized in P&L, net interest income/expense is recognized in P&L, and re-measurements are recognized in OCI and are not amortized to future P&L., Under US GAAP, the components of periodic pension cost recognized in P&L include current service costs, interest expense on the pension obligation, and expected returns on plan assets (which reduces the cost). Other components of periodic pension cost including past service costs, actuarial gains and losses, and differences between expected and actual returns on plan assets are recognized in OCI and amortized to future P&L., Estimates of the future obligation under defined benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefits are sensitive to numerous assumptions, including discount rates, assumed annual compensation increases, expected return on plan assets, and assumed health care cost inflation., Employee compensation packages are structured to fulfill varied objectives, including satisfying employees’ needs for liquidity, retaining employees, and providing incentives to employees., Common components of employee compensation packages are salary, bonuses, and share-based compensation., Share based compensation serves to align employees’ interests with those of the shareholders. It includes stocks and stock options., Share based compensation has the advantage of requiring no current-period cash outlays., Share based compensation expense is reported at fair value under IFRS and US GAAP., The valuation technique, or option pricing model, that a company uses is an important choice in determining fair value and is disclosed., Key assumptions and input into option pricing models include such items as exercise price, stock price volatility, estimated life of each award, estimated number of options that will be forfeited, dividend yield, and the risk free rate of interest. Certain assumptions are highly subjective, such as stock price volatility or the expected life of stock options, and can greatly change the estimated fair value and thus compensation expense.

## Technical Note

**Summary:**

Post-employment benefit plans include defined contribution and defined benefit plans. Defined benefit plans involve calculating a pension obligation and net pension liability based on employee benefits and plan assets. The components of defined benefit pension costs include service cost, interest expense, and remeasurements (IFRS) or amortization of actuarial gains/losses (US GAAP). Assumptions, such as discount rates and return on assets, can significantly impact pension obligations and costs. Adjusting for pension adjustments in notes to financial statements affects balance sheets and ratios. Pension plan notes provide cash flow and other relevant information. Share-based compensation, including stock grants and options, is reported at fair value, which is sensitive to assumptions and can impact financial statements.
