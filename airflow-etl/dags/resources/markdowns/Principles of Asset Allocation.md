## Technical Note

**Summary:**

Mean-variance optimization is a powerful tool for constructing asset allocations based on risk and return objectives. By considering an investor's economic balance sheet, liquidity needs, risk budgets, and preferences, asset allocations can be tailored to individual circumstances. Monte Carlo simulation and scenario analysis enhance robustness evaluations. Investment factors provide insights for portfolio construction and analysis. The global market portfolio offers a diversified base for asset allocation. Liabilities influence asset allocation strategies, necessitating liability-relative approaches. Goals-based asset allocation aligns investments with specific financial objectives. Heuristic and alternative methods offer complementary perspectives for asset allocation. Rebalancing policies optimize portfolio performance over time, considering factors such as market conditions and investment objectives.
