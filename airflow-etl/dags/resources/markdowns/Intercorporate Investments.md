## Summary

Investments in financial assets are those in which the investor has no significant influence. They can be measured and reported as Fair value through profit or loss. Fair value through other comprehensive income. Amortized cost. IFRS and US GAAP treat investments in financial assets in a similar manner., Fair value through profit or loss., Fair value through other comprehensive income., Amortized cost., Investments in associates and joint ventures are those in which the investor has significant influence, but not control, over the investee’s business activities. Because the investor can exert significant influence over financial and operating policy decisions, IFRS and US GAAP require the equity method of accounting because it provides a more objective basis for reporting investment income. The equity method requires the investor to recognize income as earned rather than when dividends are received. The equity investment is carried at cost, plus its share of post-acquisition income (after adjustments) less dividends received. The equity investment is reported as a single line item on the balance sheet and on the income statement., The equity method requires the investor to recognize income as earned rather than when dividends are received., The equity investment is carried at cost, plus its share of post-acquisition income (after adjustments) less dividends received., The equity investment is reported as a single line item on the balance sheet and on the income statement., IFRS and US GAAP accounting standards require the use of the acquisition method to account for business combinations. Fair value of the consideration given is the appropriate measurement for identifiable assets and liabilities acquired in the business combination., Goodwill is the difference between the acquisition value and the fair value of the target’s identifiable net tangible and intangible assets. Because it is considered to have an indefinite life, it is not amortized. Instead, it is evaluated at least annually for impairment. Impairment losses are reported on the income statement. IFRS use a one-step approach to determine and measure the impairment loss, whereas US GAAP uses a two-step approach., If the acquiring company acquires less than 100%, non-controlling (minority) shareholders’ interests are reported on the consolidated financial statements. IFRS allows the non-controlling interest to be measured at either its fair value (full goodwill) or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets (partial goodwill). US GAAP requires the non-controlling interest to be measured at fair value (full goodwill)., Consolidated financial statements are prepared in each reporting period., Special purpose (SPEs) and variable interest entities (VIEs) are required to be consolidated by the entity which is expected to absorb the majority of the expected losses or receive the majority of expected residual benefits.

## Technical Note

**Summary:**

IFRS classifies investments in financial assets based on the level of influence, using fair value or amortized cost measurement. Investments in associates and joint ventures, where significant influence exists, are accounted for using the equity method. In business combinations, the acquisition method is used with goodwill recognized if the acquisition value exceeds the fair value of tangible and intangible assets. IFRS differs from US GAAP in measuring non-controlling interests in business combinations. Special purpose and variable interest entities are consolidated if the majority of losses or benefits are absorbed or received. Different accounting methods affect financial statements by influencing asset values, equity, and income recognition.
