# Introduction

The member should be able to: describe the types of investment problems addressed by multiple linear regression and the regression process; formulate a multiple linear regression model, describe the relation between the dependent variable and several independent variables, and interpret estimated regression coefficients; and explain the assumptions underlying a multiple linear regression model and interpret residual plots indicating potential violations of these assumptions.

## Summary

Multiple linear regression is used to model the linear relationship between one dependent variable and two or more independent variables., In practice, multiple regressions are used to explain relationships between financial variables, to test existing theories, or to make forecasts., The regression process covers several decisions the analyst must make, such as identifying the dependent and independent variables, selecting the appropriate regression model, testing if the assumptions behind linear regression are satisfied, examining goodness of fit, and making needed adjustments., We have presented the multiple linear regression model and discussed violations of regression assumptions, model specification and misspecification, and models with qualitative variables., A multiple regression model is represented by the following equation:
