## Summary

Equities can provide several roles or benefits to an overall portfolio, including capital appreciation, dividend income, diversification with other asset classes, and a potential hedge against inflation., The inclusion of equities in a portfolio can be driven by a client’s goals or needs. Portfolio managers often consider the following investment objectives and constraints when deciding to include equities (or asset classes in general, for that matter) in a client’s portfolio: risk objective; return objective; liquidity requirement; time horizon; tax concerns; legal and regulatory factors; and unique circumstances., Investors often segment the equity universe according to (1) size and style; (2) geography; and (3) economic activity., Sources of equity portfolio income include dividends; securities lending fees and interest; dividend capture; covered calls; and cash-covered puts (or cash-secured puts)., Sources of equity portfolio costs include management fees; performance fees; administration fees; marketing/distribution fees; and trading costs., Shareholder engagement is the process whereby companies engage with their shareholders. The process typically includes voting on corporate matters at general meetings and other forms of communication, such as quarterly investor calls or in-person meetings., Shareholder engagement can provide benefits for both shareholders and companies. From a company’s perspective, shareholder engagement can assist in developing a more effective corporate governance culture. In turn, shareholder engagement may lead to better company performance to the benefit of shareholders (as well as other stakeholders)., Disadvantages of shareholder engagement include costs and time involved, pressure on a company to meet near-term share price or earnings targets, possible selective disclosure of information, and potential conflicts of interest., Activist investors (or activists) specialize in taking stakes in companies and creating change to generate a gain on the investment., The participation of shareholders in general meetings, also known as general assemblies, and the exercise of their voting rights are among the most influential tools available for shareholder engagement., The choice of using active management or passive management is not an “either/or” (binary) alternative but rather a decision involving a passive–active spectrum. Investors may decide to position their portfolios across the passive–active spectrum based on their confidence to outperform, client preference, suitable benchmarks, client-specific mandates, risks/costs of active management, and taxes.

## Technical Note

**Summary**

Equities contribute to portfolio diversification, capital appreciation, dividend income, and inflation hedging. Equity managers segment the investment universe based on size, style, geography, and economic activity. Owning and managing equity portfolios incur costs (e.g., fees, trading expenses) and provide income (e.g., dividends). Shareholder engagement fosters corporate governance and better company performance, but comes with costs and potential conflicts. The passive-active investment spectrum offers flexibility, with choices influenced by investor confidence, preference, and mandates.
