## Summary

Private clients and institutional clients have different concerns, primarily relating to investment objectives and constraints, investment governance, investment sophistication, regulation, and the uniqueness of individuals., Information needed in advising private clients includes personal information, financial information, and tax considerations., Basic tax strategies for private clients include tax avoidance, tax reduction, and tax deferral., A client’s planned goals are those that can be reasonably estimated or quantified within an expected time horizon, such as retirement, specific purchases, education, family events, wealth transfer, and philanthropy., Unplanned goals are those related to unforeseen financial needs, such as property repairs and medical expenses., When establishing client goals, private wealth managers consider goal quantification, goal prioritization, and goal changes., Risk tolerance refers to the level of risk an individual is willing and able to bear. Risk tolerance is the inverse of risk aversion. Risk capacity is the ability to accept financial risk. Risk perception is an individual’s subjective assessment of the risk involved in an investment decision’s outcome., Wealth managers often utilize questionnaires to assess clients’ risk tolerance. The result of a risk tolerance questionnaire, typically a numerical score, is often used as an input in the investment planning process., Wealth managers need both technical skills and non-technical (“soft”) skills in their advisory roles. Technical skills include capital markets proficiency, portfolio construction ability, financial planning knowledge, quantitative skills, technology skills, and in some situations, foreign language fluency. Soft skills include communication skills, social skills, education/coaching skills, and business development and sales skills., Capital sufficiency analysis, also known as capital needs analysis, is the process by which a wealth manager determines whether a client has, or is likely to accumulate, sufficient financial resources to meet his or her objectives., Two methods for evaluating capital sufficiency are deterministic forecasting and Monte Carlo simulation., Wealth managers use several different methods to analyze a client’s retirement goals, including mortality tables, annuities, and Monte Carlo simulation., An investment policy statement (IPS) for an individual includes the following parts: background and investment objective(s); investment parameters (risk tolerance and investment time horizon); asset class preferences; other investment preferences (liquidity and constraints); portfolio asset allocation; portfolio management (discretionary authority, rebalancing, tactical changes, implementation); duties and responsibilities; and an appendix for additional details., Two primary approaches to constructing a client portfolio are a traditional approach and a goals-based investing approach., Portfolio reporting involves periodically providing clients with information about their investment portfolio and performance. Portfolio review refers to meetings or phone conversations between a wealth manager and a client to discuss the client’s investment strategy. The key difference between portfolio reporting and portfolio review is that the wealth manager is more actively engaged in a review., The success of an investment program involves achieving client goals, following a consistent process, and realizing favorable portfolio performance., Ethical considerations for private wealth managers include “know your customer” (KYC), fiduciary duty and suitability, confidentiality, and conflicts of interest., Several global regulations have relevance for private wealth managers., Key private wealth segments include mass affluent, high net worth, and ultra high net worth., Robo-advisors have emerged in the mass affluent client segment. These advisors have a primarily digital client interface. Robo-advisor service providers generally charge lower fees than traditional wealth management firms. Scalability of technology has enabled robo-advisors to service investors with relatively small portfolios.
