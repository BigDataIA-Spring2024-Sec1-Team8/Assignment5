## Summary

The existence of informational frictions and externalities creates a need for regulation. Regulation is expected to have societal benefits and should be assessed using cost–benefit analysis., The regulation of securities markets and financial institutions is extensive and complex because of the consequences of failures in the financial system. These consequences include financial losses, loss of confidence, and disruption of commerce., The focus of regulators in financial markets includes prudential supervision, financial stability, market integrity, and economic growth., Regulatory competition is competition among different regulatory bodies to use regulation in order to attract certain entities., The breadth of regulation of commerce necessitates the use of a framework that identifies potential areas of regulation. This framework can be referenced to identify specific areas of regulation, both existing and anticipated, that may affect the entity of interest., Legislative bodies, regulatory bodies, and courts typically enact regulation., Regulatory bodies include government agencies and independent regulators granted authority by a government or governmental agency. Some independent regulators are self-regulating organizations., Typically, legislative bodies enact broad laws or statutes. Regulatory bodies issue administrative regulations, often implementing statutes. Courts interpret statutes and administrative regulations; these interpretations may result in judicial law., Interdependence in the actions and potentially conflicting objectives of regulators is an important consideration for regulators, regulated entities, and those assessing the effects of regulation., Regulation that arises to enhance the interests of regulated entities reflects regulatory capture., Regulators have responsibility for both substantive and procedural laws. The former focuses on rights and responsibilities of entities and relationships among entities. The latter focuses on the protection and enforcement of the former., Regulatory arbitrage is the use of regulation by an entity to exploit differences in economic substance and regulatory interpretation or in regulatory regimes to the entity’s benefit., There are many regulatory tools available to regulators, including regulatory mandates and restrictions on behaviors, provision of public goods, and public financing of private projects., The choice of regulatory tool should be consistent with maintaining a stable regulatory environment. “Stable” does not mean unchanging but, rather, refers to desirable attributes of regulation, including predictability, effectiveness in achieving objectives, time consistency, and enforceability., In assessing regulation and regulatory outcomes, regulators should conduct ongoing cost–benefit analyses, develop techniques to enhance the measurement of these outcomes, and use economic principles to guide them., Net regulatory burden to the entity of interest is an important consideration for analysts.

## Technical Note

**Economic Rationale for Regulation**

Informational frictions and externalities justify regulatory intervention to protect consumers and ensure market efficiency.

**Purposes of Regulation**

Regulation aims to:
- Control commerce (e.g., antitrust laws)
- Protect financial markets (e.g., market integrity, financial stability)

**Anticompetitive Behaviors Targeted by Antitrust Laws**

Globally, antitrust laws target behaviors that restrict competition, such as:
- Price-fixing
- Monopolization

**Classifications of Regulations and Regulators**

Regulations can be classified by:
- Purpose (e.g., prudential supervision, market integrity)
- Source (e.g., legislative bodies, regulatory bodies)

**Uses of Self-Regulation in Financial Markets**

Self-regulating organizations (SROs) complement government regulators, fostering market discipline and compliance.

**Regulatory Interdependencies**

Regulatory actions can influence each other, creating potential conflicts or cooperation.

**Tools of Regulatory Intervention**

Regulators employ various tools, including:
- Mandates and restrictions
- Public goods provision
- Public financing

**Benefits and Costs of Regulation**

Regulation offers societal benefits but also imposes costs, requiring careful cost-benefit analysis.

**Considerations for Evaluating Regulatory Effects**

Assessment of regulation should consider:
- Net regulatory burden on entities
- Ongoing cost-benefit analyses
- Economic principles to guide decision-making
