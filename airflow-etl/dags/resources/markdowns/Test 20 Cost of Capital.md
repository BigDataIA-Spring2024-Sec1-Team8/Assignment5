## Summary

The weighted average cost of capital is a weighted average of the after-tax marginal costs of each source of capital: WACC = wdrd(1 – t) + wprp + were, An analyst uses the WACC in valuation. For example, the WACC is used to value a project using the net present value method: NPV = Present value of inflows – Present value of the outflows, The before-tax cost of debt is generally estimated by means of one of the two methods: yield to maturity or bond rating., The yield-to-maturity method of estimating the before-tax cost of debt uses the familiar bond valuation equation. Assuming semi-annual coupon payments, the equation is P0=PMT1(1+rd2)+…+PMTn(1+rd2)n+FV(1+rd2)n=(∑t=1nPMTt(1+rd2)t)+FV(1+rd2)n We solve for the six-month yield (rd/2) and then annualize it to arrive at the before-tax cost of debt, rd., Because interest payments are generally tax-deductible, the after-tax cost is the true, effective cost of debt to the company. If a current yield or bond rating is not available, such as in the case of a private company without rated debt or a project, the estimate of the cost of debt becomes more challenging., The cost of preferred stock is the preferred stock dividend divided by the current preferred stock price: rp=DpPp, The cost of equity is the rate of return required by a company’s common stockholders. We estimate this cost using the CAPM (or its variants) or the dividend discount method., The CAPM is the approach most commonly used to calculate the cost of common stock. The three components needed to calculate the cost of common stock are the risk-free rate, the equity risk premium, and beta: E(Ri)=RF+βi[E(RM)−RF], When estimating the cost of equity capital using the CAPM when we do not have publicly traded equity, we may be able to use the pure-play method in which we estimate the unlevered beta for a company with similar business risk, βU, βU,comparable=βL,comparable[1+((1−tcomparable)DcomparableEcomparable)] and then lever this beta to reflect the financial risk of the project or company: βL,project=βU,comparable[1+((1−tproject)DprojectEproject)], It is often the case that country and foreign exchange risk are diversified so that we can use the estimated β in the CAPM analysis. However, in the case in which these risks cannot be diversified away, we can adjust our measure of systematic risk by a country equity premium to reflect this nondiversified risk: Country equity premium=Sovereign yield spread [Annualized standard deviationof equity indexAnnualized standard deviation of thesovereign bond market in termsof the developed market currency], The dividend discount model approach is an alternative approach to calculating the cost of equity, whereby the cost of equity is estimated as follows: re=D1P0+g, We can estimate the growth rate in the dividend discount model by using published forecasts of analysts or by estimating the sustainable growth rate: g=(1−D/EPS)ROE, In estimating the cost of equity, an alternative to the CAPM and dividend discount approaches is the bond yield plus risk premium approach. In this approach, we estimate the before-tax cost of debt and add a risk premium that reflects the additional risk associated with the company’s equity., The marginal cost of capital schedule is a graph plotting the new funds raised by a company on the x-axis and the cost of capital on the y-axis. The cost of capital is level to the point at which one of the costs of capital changes, such as when the company bumps up against a debt covenant, requiring it to use another form of capital. We calculate a break point using information on when the different sources’ costs change and the proportions that the company uses when it raises additional capital: Break point=Amount of capital at which the source's cost of capital changesProportion of new capital raised from the source, Flotation costs are costs incurred in the process of raising additional capital. The preferred method of including these costs in the analysis is as an initial cash flow in the valuation analysis., Survey evidence tells us that the CAPM method is the most popular method used by companies in estimating the cost of equity. The CAPM is more popular with larger, publicly traded companies, which is understandable considering the additional analyses and assumptions required in estimating systematic risk for a private company or project.

## Technical Note

**Summary:**

* Weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the average cost of capital from different sources, weighted by their proportions.
* Taxes reduce the cost of debt capital.
* Target capital structure guides WACC estimation, and its weights reflect capital sources' relative use.
* Marginal cost of capital and investment opportunity schedule determine optimal capital spending.
* Net present value of a project considers its capital cost.
* Cost of debt can be estimated using yield-to-maturity or debt-rating methods.
* Preferred stock cost is the dividend divided by the share price.
* CAPM, dividend discount model, and bond-yield-plus risk-premium approach estimate cost of equity.
* Country risk premiums adjust cost of equity for non-diversifiable risks.
* Marginal cost of capital schedule can be upward-sloping, with breakpoints representing changes in capital sources' costs.
* Flotation costs are included in valuation analysis as an initial cash flow.
