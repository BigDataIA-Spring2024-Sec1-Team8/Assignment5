## Summary

The market discount rate is the rate of return required by investors given the risk of the investment in the bond., A bond is priced at a premium above par value when the coupon rate is greater than the market discount rate., A bond is priced at a discount below par value when the coupon rate is less than the market discount rate., The amount of any premium or discount is the present value of the “excess” or “deficiency” in the coupon payments relative to the yield-to-maturity., The yield-to-maturity, the internal rate of return on the cash flows, is the implied market discount rate given the price of the bond., A bond price moves inversely with its market discount rate., The relationship between a bond price and its market discount rate is convex., The price of a lower-coupon bond is more volatile than the price of a higher-coupon bond, other things being equal., Generally, the price of a longer-term bond is more volatile than the price of a shorter-term bond, other things being equal. An exception to this phenomenon can occur on low-coupon (but not zero-coupon) bonds that are priced at a discount to par value., Assuming no default, premium and discount bond prices are “pulled to par” as maturity nears., A spot rate is the yield-to-maturity on a zero-coupon bond., A yield-to-maturity can be approximated as a weighted average of the underlying spot rates., Between coupon dates, the full (or invoice, or “dirty”) price of a bond is split between the flat (or quoted, or “clean”) price and the accrued interest., Flat prices are quoted to not misrepresent the daily increase in the full price as a result of interest accruals., Accrued interest is calculated as a proportional share of the next coupon payment using either the actual/actual or 30/360 methods to count days., Matrix pricing is used to value illiquid bonds by using prices and yields on comparable securities having the same or similar credit risk, coupon rate, and maturity., The periodicity of an annual interest rate is the number of periods in the year., A yield quoted on a semiannual bond basis is an annual rate for a periodicity of two. It is the yield per semiannual period times two., The general rule for periodicity conversions is that compounding more frequently at a lower annual rate corresponds to compounding less frequently at a higher annual rate., Street convention yields assume payments are made on scheduled dates, neglecting weekends and holidays.The current yield is the annual coupon payment divided by the flat price, thereby neglecting as a measure of the investor’s rate of return the time value of money, any accrued interest, and the gain from buying at a discount or the loss from buying at a premium., The simple yield is like the current yield but includes the straight-line amortization of the discount or premium., The yield-to-worst on a callable bond is the lowest of the yield-to-first-call, yield-to-second-call, and so on, calculated using the call price for the future value and the call date for the number of periods., The option-adjusted yield on a callable bond is the yield-to-maturity after adding the theoretical value of the call option to the price., A floating-rate note (floater, or FRN) maintains a more stable price than a fixed-rate note because interest payments adjust for changes in market interest rates., The quoted margin on a floater is typically the specified yield spread over or under the reference rate, which we refer to as the Market Reference Rate., The discount margin on a floater is the spread required by investors, and to which the quoted margin must be set, for the FRN to trade at par value on a rate reset date., Money market instruments, having one year or less time-to-maturity, are quoted on a discount rate or add-on rate basis., Money market discount rates understate the investor’s rate of return (and the borrower’s cost of funds) because the interest income is divided by the face value or the total amount redeemed at maturity, and not by the amount of the investment., Money market instruments need to be converted to a common basis for analysis., A money market bond equivalent yield is an add-on rate for a 365-day year., The periodicity of a money market instrument is the number of days in the year divided by the number of days to maturity. Therefore, money market instruments with different times-to-maturity have annual rates for different periodicities., In theory, the maturity structure, or term structure, of interest rates is the relationship between yields-to-maturity and times-to-maturity on bonds having the same currency, credit risk, liquidity, tax status, and periodicity., A spot curve is a series of yields-to-maturity on zero-coupon bonds., A frequently used yield curve is a series of yields-to-maturity on coupon bonds., A par curve is a series of yields-to-maturity assuming the bonds are priced at par value., In a cash market, the delivery of the security and cash payment is made on a settlement date within a customary time period after the trade date—for example, “T + 3.”, In a forward market, the delivery of the security and cash payment are made on a predetermined future date., A forward rate is the interest rate on a bond or money market instrument traded in a forward market., An implied forward rate (or forward yield) is the breakeven reinvestment rate linking the return on an investment in a shorter-term zero-coupon bond to the return on an investment in a longer-term zero-coupon bond., An implied forward curve can be calculated from the spot curve., Implied spot rates can be calculated as geometric averages of forward rates., A fixed-income bond can be valued using a market discount rate, a series of spot rates, or a series of forward rates., A bond yield-to-maturity can be separated into a benchmark and a spread., Changes in benchmark rates capture macroeconomic factors that affect all bonds in the market—inflation, economic growth, foreign exchange rates, and monetary and fiscal policy., Changes in spreads typically capture microeconomic factors that affect the particular bond—credit risk, liquidity, and tax effects., Benchmark rates are usually yields-to-maturity on government bonds or fixed rates on interest rate swaps., A G-spread is the spread over or under a government bond rate, and an I-spread is the spread over or under an interest rate swap rate., A G-spread or an I-spread can be based on a specific benchmark rate or on a rate interpolated from the benchmark yield curve., A Z-spread (zero-volatility spread) is based on the entire benchmark spot curve. It is the constant spread that is added to each spot rate such that the present value of the cash flows matches the price of the bond., An option-adjusted spread (OAS) on a callable bond is the Z-spread minus the theoretical value of the embedded call option.

## Technical Note

**Technical Note: Bond Pricing and Yield Measures**

**Bond Pricing**

* A bond's price is determined by its coupon rate, maturity, and market discount rate (yield-to-maturity).
* A bond is priced at a premium when its coupon rate exceeds the market discount rate and at a discount when its coupon rate is lower.
* The yield-to-maturity is the internal rate of return on the bond's cash flows.

**Spot Rates and Matrix Pricing**

* Spot rates are yield-to-maturities on zero-coupon bonds.
* A bond's price can be approximated as the weighted average of the underlying spot rates.
* Matrix pricing is used to value illiquid bonds based on comparable securities.

**Yield Measures for Fixed-Rate Bonds**

* Annual yields are calculated based on the periodicity of interest payments.
* Current yield ignores the time value of money and accrued interest.
* Simple yield includes amortization of discount or premium.
* Yield-to-worst considers future call dates for callable bonds.

**Yield Measures for Floating-Rate Notes**

* Floating-rate notes adjust interest payments to market interest rates, maintaining a stable price.
* The quoted margin is the spread over the reference rate.
* The discount margin is the required spread for the FRN to trade at par.

**Money Market Instruments**

* Money market instruments are quoted on a discount rate basis, which understates the investor's return.
* Money market bond equivalent yield and periodicity provide a common basis for analysis.

**Yield Curves and Forward Rates**

* Spot curves, yield curves, and forward curves represent graphical relationships between yields and maturities.
* Forward rates are used to determine future interest rates based on current spot rates.
* Implied forward rates can be calculated from the spot curve, and vice versa.

**Yield Spread Measures**

* Yield spreads compare different benchmark rates or spot rates.
* G-spreads and I-spreads measure the spread over government bond rates or interest rate swaps.
* Z-spreads and OAS consider the entire spot curve or embedded call options.
