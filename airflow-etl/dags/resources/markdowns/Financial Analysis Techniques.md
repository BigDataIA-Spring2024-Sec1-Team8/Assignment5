## Summary

Common-size financial statements and financial ratios remove the effect of size, allowing comparisons of a company with peer companies (cross-sectional analysis) and comparison of a company’s results over time (trend or time-series analysis)., Activity ratios measure the efficiency of a company’s operations, such as collection of receivables or management of inventory. Major activity ratios include inventory turnover, days of inventory on hand, receivables turnover, days of sales outstanding, payables turnover, number of days of payables, working capital turnover, fixed asset turnover, and total asset turnover., Liquidity ratios measure the ability of a company to meet short-term obligations. Major liquidity ratios include the current ratio, quick ratio, cash ratio, and defensive interval ratio., Solvency ratios measure the ability of a company to meet long-term obligations. Major solvency ratios include debt ratios (including the debt-to-assets ratio, debt-to-capital ratio, debt-to-equity ratio, and financial leverage ratio) and coverage ratios (including interest coverage and fixed charge coverage)., Profitability ratios measure the ability of a company to generate profits from revenue and assets. Major profitability ratios include return on sales ratios (including gross profit margin, operating profit margin, pretax margin, and net profit margin) and return on investment ratios (including operating ROA, ROA, return on total capital, ROE, and return on common equity)., Ratios can also be combined and evaluated as a group to better understand how they fit together and how efficiency and leverage are tied to profitability., ROE can be analyzed as the product of the net profit margin, asset turnover, and financial leverage. This decomposition is sometimes referred to as DuPont analysis., Valuation ratios express the relation between the market value of a company or its equity (for example, price per share) and some fundamental financial metric (for example, earnings per share)., Ratio analysis is useful in the selection and valuation of debt and equity securities and is a part of the credit rating process., Ratios can also be computed for business segments to evaluate how units within a business are performing., The results of financial analysis provide valuable inputs into forecasts of future earnings and cash flow.

**Classification of Financial Ratios:**

| Ratio Type | Measures | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Activity | Efficiency of operations | Inventory Turnover, Receivables Turnover |
| Liquidity | Short-term solvency | Current Ratio, Quick Ratio |
| Solvency | Long-term solvency | Debt-to-Equity Ratio, Interest Coverage |
| Profitability | Profitability from revenue and assets | Return on Equity (ROE), Gross Profit Margin |
| Valuation | Market value relative to financial metrics | Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E), Price-to-Book Ratio (P/B) |

**DuPont Analysis:**

DuPont analysis decomposes ROE into its components:

```
ROE = Net Profit Margin × Asset Turnover × Financial Leverage
```

**Segment Reporting:**

* Provides information on the performance of different business units.
* Segment ratios can be calculated to evaluate individual segment performance.

**Uses and Limitations of Ratio Analysis:**

* **Uses:**
    * Compare companies within an industry
    * Track a company's performance over time
    * Identify potential areas for improvement
* **Limitations:**
    * May be influenced by industry norms or accounting policies
    * Can be distorted by seasonal or one-time events
    * Require careful interpretation and consideration of multiple ratios

**Applications in Equity and Credit Analysis:**

* Ratios used in equity analysis: P/E ratio, ROE
* Ratios used in credit analysis: debt ratios, coverage ratios

**Modeling and Forecasting:**

* Financial analysis techniques can be used to build models and forecast future earnings and cash flow.
* These forecasts are valuable for decision-making and investment planning.
