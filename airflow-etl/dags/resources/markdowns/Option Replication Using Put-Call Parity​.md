# Introduction

The member should be able to: explain put–call parity for European options, and explain put–call forward parity for European options.

## Summary

Put–call parity establishes a relationship that allows the price of a call option to be derived from the price of a put option with the same underlying details and vice versa., Put–call parity holds for European options with the same exercise price and expiration date, representing a no-arbitrage relationship between put option, call option, underlying asset, and risk-free asset prices., If put–call parity does not hold, then riskless arbitrage profit opportunities may be available to investors., Put–call forward parity extends the put–call parity relationship to forward contracts given the equivalence of an underlying asset position and a long forward contract plus a risk-free bond., Under put–call forward parity, we may demonstrate that a purchased put option and a sold call option are equivalent to a long risk-free bond and short forward position, and a sold put and purchased call are equivalent to a long forward and short risk-free bond., Put–call parity may be applied beyond option-based strategies in finance—for example, to demonstrate that equityholders have a position equivalent to a purchased call option on the value of the firm with unlimited upside, while debtholders have a sold put option position on firm value with limited upside.

## Technical Note

**Put-Call Parity for European Options**

* Put-call parity establishes a no-arbitrage relationship between put options, call options, underlying asset prices, and risk-free asset prices.
* For European options with the same exercise price and expiration date, the following equation holds:

```
C + P - S = PV(K)
```

* Where C is the call price, P is the put price, S is the underlying asset price, K is the exercise price, and PV(K) is the present value of K.

**Put-Call Forward Parity for European Options**

* Extends put-call parity to forward contracts, given the equivalence of an underlying asset position and a long forward contract plus a risk-free bond.
* For European options and a forward contract, the following equations hold:

```
Purchased Put + Sold Call = Long Risk-Free Bond + Short Forward
Sold Put + Purchased Call = Long Forward + Short Risk-Free Bond
```

* Demonstrates the equivalence of different option and forward positions, allowing for arbitrage opportunities if the relationships do not hold.
