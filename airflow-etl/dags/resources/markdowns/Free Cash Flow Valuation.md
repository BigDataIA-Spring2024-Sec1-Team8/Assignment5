## Summary

Free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) and free cash flow to equity (FCFE) are the cash flows available to, respectively, all of the investors in the company and to common stockholders., Analysts like to use free cash flow (either FCFF or FCFE) as the return if the company is not paying dividends; if the company pays dividends but the dividends paid differ significantly from the company’s capacity to pay dividends; if free cash flows align with profitability within a reasonable forecast period with which the analyst is comfortable; or if the investor takes a control perspective., if the company is not paying dividends;, if the company pays dividends but the dividends paid differ significantly from the company’s capacity to pay dividends;, if free cash flows align with profitability within a reasonable forecast period with which the analyst is comfortable; or, if the investor takes a control perspective., The FCFF valuation approach estimates the value of the firm as the present value of future FCFF discounted at the weighted average cost of capital: Firm value = ∑ t = 1 ∞ FCFF t ( 1 + WACC ) t . The value of equity is the value of the firm minus the value of the firm’s debt: Equity value = Firm value – Market value of debt. Dividing the total value of equity by the number of outstanding shares gives the value per share. The WACC formula is WACC = MV ( Debt ) MV ( Debt ) + MV ( Equity ) r d ( 1 − Tax rate ) + MV(Equity) MV ( Debt ) + MV ( Equity ) r ., The value of the firm if FCFF is growing at a constant rate is Firm value = FCFF 1 WACC − g = FCFF 0 ( 1 + g ) WACC − g ., With the FCFE valuation approach, the value of equity can be found by discounting FCFE at the required rate of return on equity, r: Equity value = ∑ t = 1 ∞ FCFE t ( 1 + r ) t . Dividing the total value of equity by the number of outstanding shares gives the value per share., The value of equity if FCFE is growing at a constant rate is Equity value = FCFE 1 r − g = FCFE 0 ( 1 + g ) r − g ., FCFF and FCFE are frequently calculated by starting with net income: FCFF = NI + NCC + Int(1 – Tax rate) – FCInv – WCInv. FCFE = NI + NCC – FCInv – WCInv + Net borrowing., FCFF and FCFE are related to each other as follows: FCFE = FCFF – Int(1 – Tax rate) + Net borrowing., FCFF and FCFE can be calculated by starting from cash flow from operations: FCFF = CFO + Int(1 – Tax rate) – FCInv. FCFE = CFO – FCInv + Net borrowing., FCFF can also be calculated from EBIT or EBITDA: FCFF = EBIT(1 – Tax rate) + Dep – FCInv – WCInv. FCFF = EBITDA(1 – Tax rate) + Dep(Tax rate) – FCInv – WCInv. FCFE can then be found by using FCFE = FCFF – Int(1 – Tax rate) + Net borrowing., Finding CFO, FCFF, and FCFE may require careful interpretation of corporate financial statements. In some cases, the necessary information may not be transparent., Earnings components such as net income, EBIT, EBITDA, and CFO should not be used as cash flow measures to value a firm. These earnings components either double-count or ignore parts of the cash flow stream., FCFF or FCFE valuation expressions can be easily adapted to accommodate complicated capital structures, such as those that include preferred stock., A general expression for the two-stage FCFF valuation model is Firm value = ∑ t = 1 n FCFF t ( 1 + WACC ) t + FCFF n + 1 ( WACC − g ) 1 ( 1 + WACC ) n ., A general expression for the two-stage FCFE valuation model is Equity value = ∑ t = 1 n FCFE t ( 1 + r ) t + ( FCFE n + 1 r − g ) [ 1 ( 1 + r ) n ] ., One common two-stage model assumes a constant growth rate in each stage, and a second common model assumes declining growth in Stage 1 followed by a long-run sustainable growth rate in Stage 2., To forecast FCFF and FCFE, analysts build a variety of models of varying complexity. A common approach is to forecast sales, with profitability, investments, and financing derived from changes in sales., Three-stage models are often considered to be good approximations for cash flow streams that, in reality, fluctuate from year to year., Non-operating assets, such as excess cash and marketable securities, noncurrent investment securities, and nonperforming assets, are usually segregated from the company’s operating assets. They are valued separately and then added to the value of the company’s operating assets to find total firm value.

## Technical Note

**Summary:**

Free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) and free cash flow to equity (FCFE) are key metrics used to value a company's future cash flow potential. FCFF represents cash flow available to all investors, while FCFE is available to common shareholders. FCFF is calculated by adjusting net income for non-cash expenses, working capital changes, and capital expenditures, while FCFE excludes interest expense and net borrowing.

To forecast FCFF and FCFE, analysts use sales forecasts and assumptions about profitability, investments, and financing. FCFF and FCFE models are classified into single-stage (stable growth), two-stage (declining growth followed by stable growth), and three-stage (irregular cash flow patterns).

The FCFE model is similar to dividend discount models but considers both dividends and share repurchases. Dividends, share repurchases, and leverage changes can impact future FCFF and FCFE.

Net income and EBITDA are not reliable cash flow proxies. By incorporating sensitivity analysis, analysts can assess the impact of changes in input assumptions on valuation.

To determine terminal value in multistage models, analysts use perpetuity growth rate or exit multiple approaches. By comparing the present value of FCFF or FCFE to the current stock price, investors can evaluate whether a stock is overvalued, fairly valued, or undervalued.
