The member should be able to: explain the uses and limitations of classifying investors into personality types; discuss how behavioral factors affect adviser–client interactions; discuss how behavioral factors influence portfolio construction; explain how behavioral finance can be applied to the process of portfolio construction; discuss how behavioral factors affect analyst forecasts and recommend remedial actions for analyst biases; discuss how behavioral factors affect investment committee decision making and recommend techniques for mitigating their effects; describe how behavioral biases of investors can lead to market characteristics that may not be explained by traditional finance.

## Summary

Classifying investors into investor types based on their characteristics, including level of risk tolerance, preferred approach to investing, and behavioral characteristics and biases, is useful for providing insight and financial decision making but should be used with some caution., Adviser–client relations and financial decisions will be more effective and satisfying if behavioral factors are taken into account., Including behavioral factors in portfolio construction may result in a portfolio that is closer to the efficient portfolio of traditional finance, while being easier for the client to understand and accept as suitable. By considering behavioral biases, it is possible to moderate their effects., All market participants, even those with significant knowledge of and experience in finance, may exhibit behavioral biases. Analysts are not immune. Analysts, in general, are prone to overconfidence, representativeness, availability, illusion of control, and hindsight biases. Awareness of their biases and their potential influences can help analysts put in place measures to help moderate the effect of these biases., Analysts interpreting information provided by management should consider and adjust for the biases that analysts and management teams are typically susceptible to, including framing, anchoring and adjustment, availability, and overconfidence. Management biases can affect both the choice of information presented and how it is presented. These may have an effect on the analysis., Committees often have the responsibility for making investment decisions and are subject to behavioral biases. It is important to implement procedures to alleviate the effect of behavioral biases and improve committee decision making., Behavioral finance has the potential to explain some apparent deviations from market efficiency (market anomalies).
