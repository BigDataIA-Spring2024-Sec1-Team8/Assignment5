## Technical Note

**Summary**

The GIPS (Global Investment Performance Standards) were developed in response to concerns about the inconsistency and lack of transparency in investment performance reporting. They establish guidelines for fair and accurate presentation of investment results, ensuring that investors can make informed decisions. The standards apply to investment firms and individuals responsible for managing investment portfolios. Firms and investors benefit from increased transparency, comparability, and trust. Key concepts include reporting based on composites, which represent the performance of multiple portfolios, and adherence to specific methodologies for the calculation of returns and fees. Compliance requires clear definitions of the firm and discretion, as well as independent verification by a qualified third party.
