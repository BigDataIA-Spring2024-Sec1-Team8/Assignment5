## Summary

Cash flow activities are classified into three categories: operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. Significant non-cash transaction activities (if present) are reported by using a supplemental disclosure note to the cash flow statement., Cash flow statements under IFRS and US GAAP are similar; however, IFRS provide companies with more choices in classifying some cash flow items as operating, investing, or financing activities., Companies can use either the direct or the indirect method for reporting their operating cash flow: The direct method discloses operating cash inflows by source (e.g., cash received from customers, cash received from investment income) and operating cash outflows by use (e.g., cash paid to suppliers, cash paid for interest) in the operating activities section of the cash flow statement. The indirect method reconciles net income to operating cash flow by adjusting net income for all non-cash items and the net changes in the operating working capital accounts., The direct method discloses operating cash inflows by source (e.g., cash received from customers, cash received from investment income) and operating cash outflows by use (e.g., cash paid to suppliers, cash paid for interest) in the operating activities section of the cash flow statement., The indirect method reconciles net income to operating cash flow by adjusting net income for all non-cash items and the net changes in the operating working capital accounts., The cash flow statement is linked to a company’s income statement and comparative balance sheets and to data on those statements., Although the indirect method is most commonly used by companies, an analyst can generally convert it to an approximation of the direct format by following a simple three-step process., An evaluation of a cash flow statement should involve an assessment of the sources and uses of cash and the main drivers of cash flow within each category of activities., The analyst can use common-size statement analysis for the cash flow statement. Two approaches to developing the common-size statements are the total cash inflows/total cash outflows method and the percentage of net revenues method., The cash flow statement can be used to determine free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) and free cash flow to equity (FCFE)., The cash flow statement may also be used in financial ratios that measure a company’s profitability, performance, and financial strength.

## Technical Note

**Summary**

Cash flow statements classify activities into operating, investing, and financing categories. Non-cash transactions are disclosed in notes. IFRS and US GAAP have some differences in classification. The direct method reports operating cash inflows and outflows, while the indirect method reconciles net income to operating cash flow. The cash flow statement links to the income statement and balance sheet. Free cash flow and cash flow ratios provide insights into a company's financial health. Common-size statements help analyze cash flow trends. The indirect method can be converted to an approximation of the direct method.
