# Introduction

The member should be able to: compare the value and price of forward and futures contracts explain why forward and futures prices differ

## Summary

Futures are standardized, exchange-traded derivatives (ETDs) with zero initial value and a futures price f0(T) established at inception. The futures price, f0(T), equals the spot price compounded at the risk-free rate as in the case of a forward contract., The primary difference between forward and futures valuation is the daily settlement of futures gains and losses via a margin account. Daily settlement resets the futures contract value to zero at the current futures price ft(T). This process continues until contract maturity and the futures price converge to the spot price, ST., The cumulative realized mark-to-market (MTM) gain or loss on a futures contract is approximately the same as for a comparable forward contract., Daily settlement and margin requirements give rise to different cash flow patterns between futures and forwards, resulting in a pricing difference between the two contract types. The difference depends on both interest rate volatility and the correlation between interest rates and futures prices., The futures price for short-term interest rate futures is given by (100 â€“ yield), where yield is expressed in percentage terms. There is a price difference between interest rate futures and forward rate agreements (FRAs) due to convexity bias., The emergence of derivatives central clearing has introduced futures-like margining requirements for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, such as forwards. This arrangement has reduced the difference in the cash flow impact of ETDs and OTC derivatives and the price difference in futures versus forwards.

## Technical Note

**Summary**

* Futures are standardized ETDs with zero initial value and futures price f0(T).
* Futures price initially equals spot price compounded at the risk-free rate, similar to a forward contract.
* Unlike forwards, futures have daily settlement of gains/losses, resetting the value to zero at ft(T).
* Daily settlement yields similar cumulative MTM gains/losses as forwards.
* Cash flow differences between futures and forwards result in pricing differences due to interest rate volatility and correlation.
* Futures price for short-term interest rates is (100 - yield).
* Interest rate futures differ in price from FRAs due to convexity bias.
* Central clearing has reduced the difference in cash flow and price between futures and forwards.
