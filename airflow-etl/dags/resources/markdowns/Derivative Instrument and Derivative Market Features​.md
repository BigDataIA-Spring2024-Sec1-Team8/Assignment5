**Definition and Features of Derivatives**

A derivative is a financial contract whose value is derived from the performance of an underlying asset. Derivatives are used to create or modify exposure to an underlying asset, expanding the set of opportunities available in the market. Common underlying assets include equities, fixed income, currencies, commodities, and credit.

**Derivative Markets**

Derivative markets facilitate the trading of these instruments. The two main types of derivative markets are over-the-counter (OTC) and exchange-traded derivative (ETD) markets.

**OTC Markets**

In OTC markets, contracts are customized and negotiated directly between counterparties. These markets offer flexibility and privacy but may have lower transparency and liquidity compared to ETD markets.

**ETD Markets**

ETD markets trade standardized contracts on organized exchanges. These markets provide greater transparency and liquidity, but may have less flexibility in contract terms. Collateral is required on deposit for ETDs to mitigate counterparty default risk.

**Central Clearing**

For centrally cleared derivatives, a central counterparty (CCP) assumes the counterparty credit risk and provides clearing and settlement services. This reduces counterparty risk and enhances market stability.
