Question,Answer
"What is a measure for identifying potential outliers in regression analysis?

A) Leverage  
B) Standard deviation  
C) Studentized residuals  
D) Confidence interval","C) Studentized residuals  

Explanation: Studentized residuals are used to identify potential outliers in regression analysis. If the studentized residual is greater than the critical value of the t-statistic with n – k – 2 degrees of freedom, then the observation is potentially influential."
"In logistic regression, what transformation is applied to the event probability to linearize the relationship with independent variables?

A) Exponential transformation  
B) Square root transformation  
C) Logistic transformation  
D) Natural logarithm transformation","C) Logistic transformation  

Explanation: In logistic regression, the logistic transformation of the event probability (P) into the log odds, ln[P/(1 − P)], is applied to linearize the relationship with independent variables."
"What is a measure used to identify influential data points in regression analysis by measuring the change in regression values if observation i is deleted?

A) Standard deviation  
B) Variance inflation factor  
C) Cook's distance  
D) Durbin-Watson statistic","C) Cook's distance  

Explanation: Cook's distance, or Cook's D, is a metric for identifying influential data points in regression analysis. It measures how much the estimated values of the regression change if observation i is deleted. If Di > 2 √_k / n, then the observation is highly likely to be influential."
"What type of variable represents qualitative independent variables in regression analysis by taking a value of 1 or 0?

A) Ordinal variable  
B) Interval variable  
C) Dummy variable  
D) Continuous variable","C) Dummy variable  

Explanation: Dummy variables represent qualitative independent variables in regression analysis. They take a value of 1 (for true) or 0 (for false) to indicate whether a specific condition applies, such as industry sector or presence of a categorical variable."
"What method is typically used to estimate logistic regression coefficients?

A) Least squares estimation  
B) Maximum likelihood estimation  
C) Ordinary least squares estimation  
D) Ridge regression","B) Maximum likelihood estimation  

Explanation: Logistic regression coefficients are typically estimated using the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method, which is commonly used for logistic regression models."
